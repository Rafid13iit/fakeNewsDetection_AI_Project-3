bangladesh,"The Opportunity Economy (OE) is not only an inclusive economic system, but a new paradigm. It is considered to be an alternative economic model making economic opportunities available to all citizens of a nation. Its definition consists of concepts such as inclusion in growth, which includes segments of the population who are excluded from economic growth, thereby increasing diversity by creating opportunities available to all to utilise their potential. Many countries, affluent or impoverished, use the Opportunity Economy in a flexible way to meet their national economic and political goals. The goal is to benefit the underprivileged people in society as they do not have meaningful access to resources and education. People, culture, and collaboration create the Opportunity Economy ecosystem that enables success in achieving the desired goals of the economy. Furthermore, the Opportunity Economy requires a holistic approach. It addresses the issue of communities and individuals who are left behind owing to the political and economic systems of the country. This could be in terms of them not having adequate or proper access to education, skills training and job opportunities along with them being the victims of existing inequality in society. In many societies, like in Bangladesh, fascism and corruption defeated attempts to reach needy and underprivileged populations. If the OE is implemented in Bangladesh with a national mandate, it will recognise human potential, and open doors to creativity and innovation for all, thus creating opportunities for all to succeed. The question of the Opportunity Economy arises because   economic capitalism, trickle-down economics (supply side economics), fails to meet the aspirations of the masses in any society, whether it is affluent or impoverished. Trickle-down economics is defined as ""economic policies that disproportionately favor the upper tiers of the economic spectrum"", comprising of wealthy people and large businesses.  US Vice-President Kamala Harris, also a 2024 presidential candidate, included the Opportunity Economy in her economic plan to meet the aspirations of common people, as trickle-down capitalism failed to meet the aspirations of people and communities who were left behind. An Opportunity Economy is built on three pillars: first, there is inclusive growth,  where all segments of the population or society have access to economic growth; second, there is access to education and skills development, meaning equal access to education, and skills  to compete in the modern workforce; and third,  entrepreneurship and innovation. When Dr Yunus said 'everyone in the world is an entrepreneur, he recognised the potential of individuals in villages and economically poor communities. Among the countries implementing the opportunity economy are Singapore Denmark, Canada, New Zealand, and Sweden. These countries invest in creating opportunities for every segment of their societies and their primary areas of investment are education, skills training and supporting entrepreneurs and innovation. Here is a list of alternative economic models that are being  used to create opportunities and can be considered as OE initiatives: 1.Three Zero Economic System (Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions) 2.SDG (the Sustainable Development Goals) 3.OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development)-Bangladesh participates in UN sponsored SDG and is not a member of OECD Three Zero initiatives-There are a few such significant initiatives under Dr Muhammad Yunus Among these four approaches, the Three Zero Economic System and  OECD initiatives are more aligned with Opportunity Economy than SDG. Dr Muhammad Yunus's  book, A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions, offers a new paradigm for an emerging economic system. The Three Zero Economy it speaks of is based on four key principles which are social business, microfinance, sustainable energy, and inclusive growth. It is a form of social capitalism, which incorporates ""innovative social businesses designed to serve human needs rather than accumulate wealth"". The United Nations adopted the SDGs in 2015 and it consisted of a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity. The past corrupt Bangladesh government adopted the SDGs and showed that attempts were being made to achieve them. However, in the 2023 achievement report, there was no data on progress made, instead only reporting on goals to be achieved by 2030. All government departments, the parliament and the prime minister's office were involved. Yet, it did not involve the public and had no citizens' input, output, or reporting. Thirty-eight member countries of the OECD created WISE (Centre on Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity) to focus on generating higher well-being, fewer inequalities, and better health for people. Though they consider GDP (Gross Domestic Product) as an important measure, they believe it fails to capture many aspects of human life along with activities in terms of well-being. They believe multiple measures are necessary to develop a holistic perspective, and as such, WISE reports include civic engagement, social connections, work-life balance, social safety, environmental quality, knowledge and skills, health, work and job quality, housing, and income and wealth. Businesses have a responsibility to make positive contributions to the society and meet stakeholder expectations and demands. In contrast, the SDGs are focused on development only. The OECD's comprehensive approach supports OE. I believe that, under the leadership of Dr Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh can be an ideal Opportunity Economy system with a public mandate. The country needs motivated, honest, and sincere people who are engaged in planning and implementing the new economy to create an inclusive and fair economic system that provides opportunities to all as the fruits of liberation. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"The High Court today deferred the hearing on a writ petition challenging the legality of Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, which mandates the cancellation of a lawmaker's membership for voting against the political party that nominated them. The deferment order was issued by the bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury after writ petitioner Advocate Md Eunus Ali Akond was unable to produce a certified copy of the 2018 High Court verdict that had dismissed a similar petition he filed challenging Article 70. Advocate Akond told The Daily Star that he would obtain the certified copy of the 2017 verdict and present it to the High Court bench led by Justice Farah Mahbub to proceed with his current petition. On October 23, Advocate Akond, a Supreme Court lawyer, filed the latest writ petition with the High Court, arguing that Article 70 should be scrapped as it contradicts democratic principles. He cited a 2017 observation by an Appellate Division bench, led by then Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, which stated that Article 70 conflicted with constitutional provisions. Previously, on August 18, 2018, a High Court bench comprising Justice Abu Taher Md Saifur Rahman had dismissed a similar petition from Akond, noting that the court could not interfere in Article 70 as it was embedded in the original 1972 Constitution. The bench had observed that members of parliament, elected under political party manifestos, are not permitted to vote against their party. Under Article 70, lawmakers must vacate their seats if they vote against the party that nominated them. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
tech-startup,"Google is reportedly working on a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool, codenamed 'Project Jarvis,' designed to automate online tasks, according to sources cited by The Information. The system would operate directly within a web browser, performing actions on users' behalf such as conducting research, purchasing products, and booking flights. Jarvis is expected to leverage an advanced version of Google's Gemini AI model, optimised for use within Chrome. This ""computer-using agent"" would interpret on-screen information, click buttons, and input text commands, helping users accomplish various web-based tasks. Though details are still emerging, the tool reportedly takes ""a few seconds"" between each action in its current stage. Should the project progress smoothly, Google may unveil a preview of Jarvis as early as December. However, The Information notes that this timeline is subject to change, as Google is still exploring the possibility of limited testing to identify potential bugs and areas for refinement. Google's move follows a broader trend among tech companies developing similar AI-driven models for automating digital tasks. Competitors include Microsoft's Copilot Vision, Apple's anticipated screen-aware intelligence updates, and recent releases from companies such as Anthropic and OpenAI. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
sports,"United Nations rights experts on Monday slammed decisions in France barring women and girls who wear the Muslim headscarf from sports competitions as ""discriminatory"", demanding they be reversed. France invoked its strict rules on secularism to ban its athletes from wearing religious symbols, including the hijab, during the Paris 2024 Olympics. And France's football and basketball federations have also opted to exclude players wearing the headscarf from competitions, including at the amateur level. These decisions ""are disproportionate and discriminatory, and infringe on their rights (of French athletes) to freely manifest their identity, their religion or belief in private and in public, and to take part in cultural life,"" said a statement signed by eight independent UN experts. ""Muslim women and girls who wear the hijab must have equal rights to participate in cultural and sporting life, and to take part in all aspects of French society of which they are a part,"" they said. The statement was signed by the UN special rapporteurs on cultural rights, on minority issues, and on freedom of religion and belief, and members of the UN working group on discrimination against women and girls. They are independent experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations. France's laws on secularism are intended to keep the state neutral in religious matters, while guaranteeing citizens the right to freely practice their religion. Among other things, they prohibit pupils and teachers in schools as well as civil servants from wearing ""ostentatious"" religious symbols. But the experts insisted that ""the neutrality and secular nature of the state are not legitimate grounds for imposing restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief"". ""Any limitations of these freedoms must be proportionate, necessary to reach one of the objectives stated in international law (safety, health and public order, the rights and freedoms of others), and justified by facts... and not by presumptions, assumptions or prejudices,"" they said. ""In a context of intolerance and strong stigmatisation of women and girls who choose to wear the hijab, France must take all measures at its disposal to protect them, to safeguard their rights, and to promote equality and mutual respect for cultural diversity."" চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
sports,"Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag following the club's lacklustre start to the season, the fallen Premier League giants announced Monday. United dropped to a lowly 14th in the table after suffering their fourth defeat in nine league games at West Ham on Sunday and have won only one of their last eight games in all competitions. ""Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager,"" said a club statement. ""Erik was appointed in April 2022 and led the club to two domestic trophies, winning the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024. ""We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future."" United added former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who returned to the club as Ten Hag's assistant in July, would now serve as interim manager ""whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."" Even before the West Ham loss, Dutch manager Ten Hag had presided over United's worst start to an English top-flight campaign since the 1989/90 season. The 54-year-old's position had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe kept the former Ajax boss, on board following an internal review of his position at the end of last season after an eighth-place Premier League finish. Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year extension of his contract to June 2026 after a shock FA Cup final victory over rivals Manchester City in May. However, he failed to find the solutions to many of his side's struggles from last season. Former Ajax boss Ten Hag, who joined United in May 2022, had fiercely defended his record in recent weeks after winning two trophies in his two full seasons in charge. United ended a six-year wait for silverware by beating Newcastle in the 2023 League Cup final. FA Cup reprieve  The Red Devils also reached the FA Cup final and finished third in the Premier League in an encouraging debut season for Ten Hag. However, the wheels came off in his second season as injuries to key players, the lack of a meaningful impact from big money signings and Ten Hag's failure to implement a clear style of play led to a number of embarrassing results. United crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage after defeats by Galatasaray and FC Copenhagen, while Bournemouth, Brighton and Fulham were among the other sides to win at Old Trafford in the 2023/2024 campaign. The implementation of a new sporting structure at United, spearheaded by co-owner Ratcliffe, saw widespread change over recent months off the field with the appointment of a new chief executive, sporting director and technical director. But Ten Hag's surprise victory over Pep Guardiola's all-conquering City side at Wembley in the FA Cup final, saw him handed a stay of execution. Any hope United's FA Cup glory could act as a launching pad to more regular success quickly unravelled in the opening weeks of the new season. Liverpool and Tottenham coasted to 3-0 wins at Old Trafford in September, while United failed to win either of their opening two Europa League matches against FC Twente and Porto. For all Ten Hag's faults, he oversaw just a small period of United's more general decline since legendary former manager Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Since the Scot's departute from the Old Trafford hot seat, five permanent managers have now been dismissed without United even posing a challenge for the Premier League title -- a trophy they won 13 time under Ferguson. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"BNP senior leader Mirza Abbas today said the deposed Awami League would struggle to regain political influence if BNP and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami maintain their alliance. Speaking at a memorial event organised by Dhaka South City Jamaat at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, Abbas expressed BNP's commitment to ""rebuilding the country"" with Jamaat. ""We must strive for unity so that we can rebuild this country beautifully. Let's work together for the sake of the nation. Together, we will adorn the country,"" he added. During the event, held in remembrance of Jamaat supporters killed in 2006, Abbas criticised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, claiming she had ""fled to India"" while her associates remain active in Bangladesh. ""The nation cannot progress while Hasina's cohorts are in different positions, as they are devising various plots. However, if Jamaat and BNP work together, the Awami League will not be able to stage a comeback,"" he said. ""We now desire a Bangladesh without the Awami League... the Awami League and decent people, the Awami League and democracy cannot coexist. The Awami League is actually the devil's friend,"" he added. He also urged all other democratic parties to unite in order to thwart the nefarious efforts of Hasina's cohorts and the neighbouring country. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
entertainment,"It's difficult to believe someone is gone when you can tune into an old episode and listen to him deliver his sarcastic remarks on cue, very alive and very present. Yet, today marks one year of Matthew Perry leaving an empty space on the orange couch forever. Matthew Langford Perry— popular for his portrayal of the cult-classic character of Chandler Bing in the television sitcom ""Friends""— was the funny friend, the man of dreams for many women, and the relatable character who makes jokes when he is uncomfortable. Here we are, writing about Matthew Perry or more about Chandler Bing— because what's the difference? Everyone wished for a friend like him, dreamed of a partner like him, and wanted to be him. Each friend group had a Chandler; people named their pets by his name and likened their partners to him. It's almost impossible not to talk about Chandler Bing when talking about Matthew Perry when the man behind the character himself said, ""It wasn't that I thought I could play Chandler; I was Chandler."" Matthew Perry brought warmth and genius into the role in a way only he could. Chandler Muriel Bing introduced the world of sitcoms to a gold standard that defined sarcasm in pop culture for sitcoms and generations to come. Through awkward dances, witty one-liners, his insecurities, and complicated relationships with love and family, Matthew Perry and Chandler Bing live on in fond memories and strong nostalgia. On a dull day, you can always chime into this man who lights up the screen and sends laughter tracks blaring.  Chandler's friendship with Joey was one to envy while his with Rachel was an underrated one. Ross and Chandler navigating their lives through college was a journey of its own. And when Chandler walked Phoebe down the aisle, it felt like two beautifully awkward, resilient souls finding their own sense of family, each helping the other reach their happy ending. This was the same Chandler who, once the ultimate commitment-phobe, grew into a caring and respectful partner for Monica, honouring and cherishing her in every way. Off-screen, the reality wasn't so different; the ""Friends"" cast remained close over the years, showing up for one another just as their characters did. Matthew's death affected the cast deeply. Reports say that Matt Leblanc has been a recluse lately after Perry's death.  Behind the lovely smile and the will to make people laugh all the time is a story of struggles. Matthew's battle with substance abuse dates back to 1997, when he suffered from a freak accident while jetskiing. His time in the hospital left him addicted to Vicodin, which spiralled into years of struggle. Perry admitted that he had no recollection of filming a large time of ""Friends"" between seasons 3 and 6. If you noticed the changes in his appearance through the seasons of ""Friends"", those were indications of different phases of his addiction. In his memoir, Matthew wrote, ""When I'm carrying weight, it's alcohol; when I'm skinny, it's pills. When I have a goatee, it's lots of pills."" Matthew's personal journey inspired him to open the Perry House— a sober living facility in Malibu to help recovering addicts. In 2015, he was awarded the Phoenix Rising Award for helping others. His final television appearance was in the much-awaited and celebrated ""Friends Reunion"" of 2021. In November 2022, Matthew published his memoir, ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing"" where he revealed candid moments of his life.  Besides ""Friends"", Perry has explored diverse roles throughout his career. From the bodyswap comedy of ""17 Again"" (2009) to ""Dance 'til Dawn"" (1988), Perry plays a nostalgic tribute to teen experiences. You can rediscover Perry beyond his comedic roles in ""Birds of America"" (2008) as he navigates through the responsibilities of adulthood, in his personal favourite cinematic experience ""Fools Rush In"" (1997), or a touch of comedy in crime and suspense in ""The Whole Nine Yards"" (2000) alongside Bruce Willis. One of the most memorable roles of Matthew Perry also includes his portrayal of the inspiring educator Ron Clark in the biopic ""The Ron Clark Story"" (2006), which earned him several nominations.  In season 2, episode 3 of ""Friends"", titled ""The One Where Mr Heckles Dies"", Chandler discovers eerie similarities between himself and his neighbour Mr Heckles; he worries he would die alone just like him. Chandler pushes himself to take more chances and live his life after a moment of reflection. In a tragic parallel, last year, Matthew Perry's unresponsive body was recovered from the jacuzzi of his apartment, where he lived alone, with acute effects of ketamine being the cause. An investigation looking into his death persists, with five charged over his death. His death has also opened discussions into the underground criminal network of drugs in Hollywood. US Attorney Martin Estrada stated, ""These defendants cared more about profiting off of Mr Perry than caring for his well-being."" Matthew Perry, however, did more than just live his life—he did so openly, with unflinching honesty and vulnerability. He was and will continue to be a source of comfort and inspiration for people around the world. He passed away alone but touched the lives of so many beyond his own. Even though today's audiences may find the humour of ""Friends"" dated and gravitate toward shows more suited to the evolved times, it is safe to say Chandler Bing will not be forgotten anytime soon. He was never a perfect character; in fact, his flawed, deeply human, and awkwardness made him the utterly lovable character he is. There's an empty seat now on the orange couch, but in spirits, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing remains right there. So years from now, when someone young asks where you picked up that 'lame' joke from, don't forget to tell them about Chandler Bing and the remarkable man who brought him to life, Matthew Perry.     চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Begum Rokeya University (BRU) authorities in Rangpur today suspended two teachers and seven staff members, following an announcement to ban political activities on campus this morning. The move is aimed at maintaining a disturbance-free campus, Vice Chancellor Prof Shawkat Ali announced in a press briefing after a syndicate meeting around 2:30pm. The suspended teachers are Associate Professor Moshiur Rahman from the math department, and Associate Professor Asaduzzaman Mondal from Department of Public Administration. Asaduzzaman Mondal is also the General Secretary of the BRU Teachers Association. Both of them have been named in the murder case involving Abu Sayed, the BRU student who was killed during the anti-discrimination student movement on July 16. The other seven suspended are Hafizur Rahman, assistant registrar, Mahbuba Akhter, deputy registrar of sociology department, Rafiul Hasan Russell from the proctor's office, Touhidul Islam Jony, deputy registrar security division; employees Amir Hossain, Ashikun Nahar TukTuki, and Nur Nabi. Shawkat Ali, addressing reporters outside the Administrative Building, said that eight of the ten syndicate members present at today's meeting had supported the decisions intended to restore order at the university. Since Abu Sayed's death on July 16, attendance on campus has plummeted, with faculty, staff, and students submitting leave requests to avoid returning. However, the university has now decided to revoke these leave requests, he said. According to a university probe, 91 individuals – two teachers, seven officials, and 72 students – have been identified as avoiding work since July 16, with alleged involvement in Sayed's death. The syndicate has opted to file a case against those implicated. BRU banned student political activities on campus on August 12, but extending this ban to include teachers, officials, and staff has been a priority, said the VC. The university will no longer tolerate activities such as extortion, tender manipulation, or seat trading in dormitories. Furthermore, any member of the university found engaging in political party affiliations will face immediate suspension and disciplinary action, he added. The VC said that the university has formed a body to collect statements from the individuals involved, though many have yet to comply with the probe. Ramjan Ali, brother of Abu Sayed, filed the original murder case on August 18, and BRU is set to file a separate case targeting those implicated in the death. The syndicate members present at the meetingincluded Md Shahidul Islam, Rangpur Divisional Commissioner; Prof Humayun Kabir Chowdhury of Jagannath University; Prof Siraj Ud Doula of Chittagong University, and Prof Motiur Rahman of BRU. The VC also said that five posts on the 15-member syndicate remain vacant. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

Their inability to dominate proceedings led Motta to acknowledge that his players were a long way off from challenging for the Scudetto. ""Not at this moment. We delivered a solid performance against one of the favourites for the Scudetto, alongside Napoli, who have maintained the core of their squad from a year and a half ago,"" Motta told DAZN. ""Right now, they're ahead and capable of competing until the end for the title. While today was a good performance, we need to keep our feet on the ground. ""We'll continue on our path, sticking to our ideas and our growth process. We'll see what we're capable of when the time comes. I'm being honest; I speak as things are."" Motta said he had mixed emotions about the result. ""We sought something more in terms of both play and the right spirit; we wanted a different outcome after a first half filled with unfortunate incidents,"" he said. ""They could have increased their lead but didn't, and in the end, we could have won it. However, we need to understand why we perform well at times and struggle against the opponent's game at others."" Substitute Yildiz, 19, secured the draw after coming on late in the match, with Motta defended his decision to start with Timothy Weah rather than the 19-year-old Yildiz. ""I chose Timothy Weah (to start) because he could offer something interesting for us in transitions. Kenan can help the team in the second half by providing different options, whether as a winger, midfielder, or striker,"" Motta said. ""We know we have young players, but we believe we can perform much better than we did today. It's clear that the many absences may have had an impact; it's not an excuse, but a fact."" চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Md Rakib Hasan of Kalekhar Bhanda village in Kishoreganj's Bajitpur upazila has taken a unique approach to reignite a love for reading in the younger generation. By covering the outside front walls of his house, Ananddhara, with the covers of famous books, Rakib, an avid reader himself, aims to inspire an appreciation for literature, particularly Bangla works and those tied to Bangladesh's rich cultural history, including the Language Movement and the Liberation War, he told this correspondent. Working as a general manager in a private enterprise in Dhaka, Rakib drew on his late father's love for books, continuing a family tradition of promoting reading. This wall project features covers of iconic books such as Rabindranath Tagore's ""Gitanjali"", Kazi Nazrul Islam's ""Agnibina"", Jasimuddin's ""Nakshi Kanthar Math"", Humayun Ahmed's ""Jochna O Jananir Golpo"", Syed Waliullah's ""Lalsalu"", Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's ""Pather Panchali"", Jibanananda Das's ""Bonolata Sen"", Akhteruzzaman Elias's ""Chilekothar Sepai"", and Jahanara Imam's ""Ekattorer Dinguli"". ""They provide a visual feast of literary classics for locals and visitors alike,"" Rakib told this correspondent. The book covers were given shape using steel, and vibrant colours were used over them to bring out the actual look of the book covers. ""A graphic designer helped me in designing the steel walls as book covers. It took over a year to complete the construction work of the wall adorned with book covers,"" said Rakib. The wall has become a landmark, with visitors travelling to see it, and even train passengers catching a glimpse as they pass by on the Kishoreganj-Bhairab railway line, said Gulnahar Begum, a social worker. This initiative has also sparked curiosity among local students. Touhida Akter, a schoolgirl, said the wall helps her remember the names of various authors and books, fuelling her interest in reading. Community members, such as cultural activist Swadhin Ahmed Barek and engineer Shuvon Kumar Saha, also praised Rakib's efforts. They also suggested the addition of a local library to further encourage reading. Rakib said his goal is to counter the growing digital distraction of mobile games and social media by showing young people that books offer timeless knowledge and companionship. He said his decorated wall stands as both a homage to literature and an invitation for younger generations to rediscover the joy of reading. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"A Dhaka court today ordered Mustafa Kamal Uddin, former senior secretary of the home ministry, to be sent to jail, rejecting his bail request in a case regarding the killing of Jubo Dal leader Shamim Mia in the Paltan area on October 28, 2023. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Monirul Islam issued the ruling after the case's Investigation Officer, Sub-Inspector Tonmoy Kumar Biswas of Paltan Model Police Station, presented the former secretary in court and requested he remain detained until the investigation concludes. The defence argued for bail, asserting that their client had been falsely implicated in a plot intended to harass him. The magistrate, however, denied the plea, ordering his transfer to Dhaka Central Jail in Keraniganj. Previously on October 25, the former official Mustafa Kamal Uddin was remanded for three days following a request for a 10-day remand by investigators. He had been arrested on October 24 in Chattogram and transferred to Dhaka. The case was initially filed on September 14 by Abbas Ali, a former Jubo Dal Central Committee member, at Paltan Model Police Station, implicating 704 individuals, including senior Awami League leaders, police officials, and 12,000 unnamed people in connection with Shamim Mia's death. Mustafa Kamal Uddin, who served as secretary of the Public Security Department under the Home Ministry since August 2017, retired in January 2022. In January this year, he was appointed chairman of Biman Bangladesh Airlines' board of directors. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

business,"Bangladesh's economic growth slowed sharply to 3.91 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023-24 fiscal year, suffered by downturn in the industrial production growth. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.88 percent in the same April-June period previous fiscal year. Factory output grew 3.98 percent in the April-June quarter of the FY24, down from 10.16 a year ago. Agricultural production and services sector also recorded sluggishness, according to data released by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics today. The April-June quarter marked the lowest expansion of overall economic output in 2023-24 fiscal year in Bangladesh, which faces worst ever economic crisis in recent decades owing to stubbornly high inflation and falling foreign exchange reserves. The World Bank in its October issue of Bangladesh Development Update said the real GDP growth of Bangladesh is estimated to have slowed to 5.2 percent in FY24 from 5.8 percent in FY23. The multilateral lender also slashed its forecast for Bangladesh's economic growth by 1.7 percentage points to 4 percent for FY25 due to ""significant uncertainties following recent political turmoil"" and ""data unavailability"". The International Monetary Fund last week also brought down Bangladesh's economic growth forecast for this year to 4.5 percent as political uncertainty, industrial unrest and floods weigh heavily on economic activities. The FY25 growth prediction so far would be lowest since fiscal 2019-20, when the world was hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In fiscal 2019-20, the GDP growth was 3.45 percent, according to the BBS. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

bangladesh,"Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has directed advisers to expedite the construction of a museum at Gono Bhaban, dedicated to commemorating the July-August mass uprising. The chief adviser gave these instructions during his visit to the Dhaka palace where ousted former dictator Sheikh Hasina resided for 15 years — a site that has come to symbolise the repression and severity of her rule.

sports,"Quality players like Mohamed Salah are crucial in big games, Liverpool manager Arne Slot said after the Egypt international's late strike secured a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. Salah, who said last month he was poised to leave Liverpool after this season, also scored in last weekend's 2-1 win over Chelsea, after netting the winning goal from the penalty spot at Wolverhampton Wanderers. ""I think that's one of the things that top players have, that they are always available and they show up in the big games,"" Slot told reporters. ""That's also what you need if you are a big club, like we are and like Arsenal is, then you need these quality players because if you don't have them, it's going to be quite difficult to get your results. Salah, who is tied with Robbie Fowler as Liverpool's eighth-highest goalscorer of all time with 163 strikes, has scored six goals in the league this season. Salah was on the scoresheet in five of Liverpool's seven league wins. ""It's something you need to have as a club, to have these players that can make the difference for you, and Mo was that today offensively,"" Slot added. Liverpool, who have 22 points from nine matches, are one point behind leaders Manchester City. Slot's team play Brighton & Hove Albion twice this week, away in the League Cup on Wednesday followed by a home league game on Saturday. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

bangladesh,"The 1923 Nobel laureate in literature, William Butler Yeats (1865-1939), is admired as arguably the greatest English-language poet of the 20th century. His country Ireland was the longest standing colony in Europe. It came under Anglo-Norman rule in 1169 and suffered colonial oppression for nearly 800 years. One of the major Irish uprisings against British colonialism happened in 1798. Commonly known as the Irish Rebellion of 1798, it was inspired by the American War of Independence (1775-83) and the French Revolution (1789-99). The British crushed the rebellion and instituted ""the most savage repression … to wipe out further resistance."" The next major Irish revolt to gain independence was the Easter Rising. It began on Easter Monday, on April 24, 1916, and is regarded as the ""harvest of seeds sown in 1798."" Yeats's poem ""Easter, 1916"" makes it easy to remember the date. Its four stanzas imply the fourth month (April), the first and third stanzas have 16 lines each and point to the year 1916, and the second and fourth stanzas each have 24 lines to indicate April 24. The British quelled the Easter Rising in six days and executed 15 of its top leaders through firing squads within weeks. The heavy-handed response sparked a huge outburst of anger among the Irish, many of whom—including Yeats—did not support the rebellion at the beginning. Although suppressed and ostensibly a failure, the anticolonial struggle continued and spread from Dublin to other parts of Ireland, culminating in the Irish War of Independence (1919-21). The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in December 1921 and the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act was passed in the British Parliament on March 31, 1922. Thus, 26 of Ireland's 32 counties achieved independence; the remaining six counties were and continue to be under British rule. They form what is now Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, though not as a colony in the conventional sense of the term. Yeats was mainly an intellectual and literary prodigy who was opposed to armed insurrection and bloodshed. To him, anti-imperialism was an intellectual act and cultural rejuvenation free from violence. He shared a general distrust in Irish revolutionaries and discredited their rhetoric, as his poem ""September 1913"" illustrates his disenchantment with post-John O'Leary Irish nationalist leaders. Initially, Yeats considered the bloodshed and loss of lives during Easter Rising futile and wasteful. But the unwavering dedication of the rebels changed his mind and earned his sympathy. To elegise and eulogise them, he wrote ""Easter, 1916,"" a palinode where he retracts what he said earlier in ""September 1913."" In ""Easter, 1916,"" Yeats uses the oxymoronic refrain ""a terrible beauty is born"" to glorify the heroism of the Easter rebels. To describe their devotion and tenacious commitment to freedom, he says: Hearts with one purpose alone Through summer and winter seem Enchanted to a stone. … Too long a sacrifice Can make a stone of the heart.   I don't think the imagery of ""stone"" here signifies ""extreme idealism,"" ""the frozen heart"" or ""the rigidity and inflexibility"" of the nationalists. Rather, it stands for their single-minded purpose. We can draw some parallels between the Easter rebels and the intrepid protesters of the anti-discrimination student movement (or the July 1-36, 2024 uprising). Its young stalwarts stunned the whole world with their spectacular bravery on the streets of Bangladesh. They showed unprecedented solidarity among themselves by standing their ground in the face of shoot-at-sight orders. At Sheikh Hasina's behest, shootings and helicopter strikes were carried out against our valiant young people. But they didn't hedge or budge; they didn't desert the streets even when they saw their co-protesters being killed next to them. Hundreds of them were massacred and thousands wounded. Many of the survivors are left with life-changing disabilities. As long as Hasina was in power, some of the injured couldn't even go to hospitals for treatment as police were arresting the bullet-wounded demonstrators from healthcare facilities. What motivated our youth to defy death in order to free Bangladesh from the yoke of a brutal regime? To use Yeats's imagery, their hearts were tied to—or turned into—a ""stone,"" which represents their strong resolve to liberate their land from autocracy and oppressive practices. The urge for freedom fired them up, took them to the streets, and inspired them to stay put. Hasina stayed in power from early 2009 until her fall in early August 2024. The young protagonists of the anti-discrimination student movement came of age during her rule. Hers was the only political system that they experienced firsthand. It was riddled with farcical and non-participatory elections, ballot stuffing on the eve of polls, candidate and voter intimidation, lack of transparency in the vote count, massive corruption, wholesale plundering of banks, illegal syphoning of money out of the country, and extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and other gross human rights violations.         Read moreAre we trying to get ‘everything, everywhere, all at once’? What affected the students most directly was the culture of impunity at educational environments where Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Hasina's party, the Awami League, instituted a reign of terror. Our students couldn't tolerate the totalitarian regime any longer. In June 2024, they rallied around the anti-discrimination student movement to get a fair share in the job market. Soon, Hasina's arrogance galvanised them to free their country from her autocracy in July. Hasina didn't resign in July, so our youth extended its length beyond its 31st day. Hasina fell and fled on ""July 36"" (August 5) and the country was ""liberated."" Yeats embeds memories of the Easter Uprising and immortalises its heroes in ""Easter, 1916."" The courage and strength of mind of our youth are no less inspiring and remarkable than those of the Irish rebels. We will feel artistically bereft if we don't see our litterateurs produce pieces like ""Easter, 1916"" to commemorate the sacrifices of our young people, to take pride in their ""excess of love"" for Bangladesh, and to celebrate their bravery and patriotic duty to liberate it and its people from oppression. We must document their determined courage, steadfast resilience, and the spirit of selflessness and fearlessness. Because of some bad apples among them, we once dreaded our students. But they have now restored their dignity through their heroic fortitude and feats and through their readiness to die for a cause bigger than them. We will be thrilled to read poetry containing verses like: [Abu Sayed] and [Mugdho] And [Shahriar] and [Yasin] Now and in time to be, Wherever green is worn, Are changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.

tech-startup,"Runway, a US-based AI research company specialising in creative software, has launched Act-One, a tool for generating character animations based on simple video and voice inputs. According to Runway, Act-One is designed to streamline animation production, offering an alternative to the typically complex and resource-intensive pipelines used in facial animation. Traditional animation workflows for realistic facial expressions require motion capture equipment, multiple video references, and detailed face rigging—steps that can be costly and time-consuming. Act-One bypasses these requirements by allowing users to create animated characters directly from a video and voice recording, making it feasible to produce animations with a simple camera setup, says Runway in an official blog. The tool supports a range of character styles, from realistic portrayals to stylised designs. Act-One translates facial expressions and subtle movements—such as micro-expressions and eye-line adjustments—from actors onto different character designs, even if the character's proportions differ from the source footage. This capability enables new options in character design without the need for motion capture, as per the company. Act-One also facilitates multi-character scenes, allowing a single actor to perform multiple roles. Runway adds that this feature, paired with the tool's high-fidelity outputs, may be suited for creators producing dialogue-focused videos without extensive production resources. According to Runway, they have incorporated content moderation measures in Act-One, including safeguards to prevent the unauthorised generation of public figures and technical checks to verify users' rights to any custom voice created. Act-One became available on October 22, 2024, with a phased rollout expected to expand access in the coming weeks, as per Runway's official announcement. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
business,"Rupali Bank PLC reported a profit of Tk 6.13 crore for the July-September quarter of its current financial year.  The bank also made a profit of Tk  49.80 crore in the January to September period, posting a 16 percent increase year-on-year.  As a result, consolidated diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to Tk 0.43 for the January-September period from a restated Tk 0.37 for the same period last year, according to its unaudited financial statements.    The EPS boost was driven by higher operating income, the bank said in a disclosure on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) website.  However, Rupali's net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) for January-September 2024 hit a concerning Tk 18.10 in the negative, which the bank attributed to a decrease in deposits and an increase in loans and advances. Shares of Rupali Bank were up 0.46 percent to Tk 21.8 at the DSE as of 1:26 pm today. Founded in 1972 through the merger of three commercial banks, Rupali Bank now operates through 586 branches across Bangladesh, serving as a prominent player in the nation's banking sector. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
world,"Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reached new record highs in 2023, locking in future temperature increases for years to come, the United Nations warned Monday. Levels of the three main greenhouse gases -- the climate-warming carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- all increased yet again last year, the UN's weather and climate agency said. The World Meteorological Organization said carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere faster than ever, up more than 10 percent in two decades. The WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin comes ahead of the November 11-22 COP29 UN climate summit in Baku. ""Another year. Another record. This should set alarm bells ringing among decision-makers,"" WMO chief Celeste Saulo said in a statement. ""We are clearly off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal."" Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries agreed to cap global warming at ""well below"" two degrees Celsius above average levels measured between 1850 and 1900 -- and 1.5C if possible. As long as emissions continue, greenhouse gases will keep accumulating in the atmosphere, raising global temperatures, WMO said. Last year, global temperatures on land and sea were ""the highest in records dating as far back as 1850"", it said. Given how long CO2 lasts in the atmosphere, current temperature levels will continue for decades, even if emissions rapidly shrink to net zero. - 'Real impact' - In 2023, CO2 concentrations were at 420 parts per million (ppm), methane at 1,934 parts per billion, and nitrous oxide at 336 parts per billion. That marks hikes of 151 percent, 265 percent and 125 percent of the pre-industrial levels before 1750. ""These are more than just statistics. Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet,"" said Saulo. CO2 accounts for about 64 percent of the warming effect on the climate. Its annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than two ppm -- a streak caused by ""historically large fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the 2010s and 2020s"", the report said. Last year's figure is 11.4 percent above the 337.1 ppm recorded in 2004. ""CO2 is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than at any time during human existence,"" the report said, adding that the current atmospheric CO2 level was 51 percent above that of the pre-industrial era. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now, it said. Just under half of CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere, while the rest are absorbed by the ocean and land ecosystems. But now ""we face a potential vicious cycle"", WMO deputy chief Ko Barret warned. Climate change itself could soon ""cause ecosystems to become larger sources of greenhouse gases"", she said. ""Wildfires could release more carbon emissions into the atmosphere, whilst the warmer ocean might absorb less CO2. Consequently, more CO2 could stay in the atmosphere to accelerate global warming. ""These climate feedbacks are critical concerns to human society."" চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
business,"Exim Bank of Bangladesh PLC reported a staggering Tk 566 crore loss for the July-September quarter, as declining deposits and retained earnings plummeted its earnings. The bank's consolidated loss per share hit Tk 3.91, a sharp downturn from the Tk 0.37 earnings per share it posted in the same period last year, according to a disclosure on the Dhaka Stock Exchange website. This poor performance triggered a strong market reaction, with Exim Bank shares plunging 9.64 percent to Tk 7.5 as of 12:06 pm on the DSE floor.  The bank attributed the earnings drop to a spike in provisions for investments. Cash flow challenges compounded Exim Bank's difficulties, as its net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) for January- September 2024 registered a negative Tk 16.62.  The decline in NOCFPS was primarily due to increased investments in customers and a fall in deposits. Additionally, the bank's net asset value per share weakened, driven by reduced retained earnings compared to the prior period. Exim Bank was founded in 1999, and it transitioned to Shariah-based banking in 2004, positioning itself as a key player in corporate, cottage and micro industries, and agricultural finance. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

sports,"Bukayo Saka became the youngest Arsenal player to score 50 Premier League goals when he returned from a hamstring injury in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Liverpool, but the winger was disappointed to drop two points after being on the verge of a crucial win. Saka, who was injured during England's loss to Greece earlier this month, scored early to become the league's seventh youngest player to reach 50 goals at 23 years and 52 days, eight days older than when England's top scorer Harry Kane netted his 50th Premier League goal. Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler remains the youngest to reach the milestone at 20 years and 252 days, ahead of fellow strikers Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Romelu Lukaku, with Cristiano Ronaldo the fifth youngest. ""I hate to miss games, so I was buzzing to be back. I had this game in mind to come back for and I was feeling good out there, and I was happy to get an early goal,"" Saka told Arsenal's official website. ""We are disappointed. I feel like we didn't show our best selves for 90 minutes and it cost us in the end. We believe we should have won it."" Manager Mikel Arteta also praised Saka's consistency as one of the positives in the match that saw key players Gabriel Magalhaes and Jurrien Timber leave the field with injuries. ""After a few weeks off, the way he played and competed was exceptional. I think we had some big, big individual performances in the team,"" Arteta said.

tech-startup,"Indonesia has officially banned the sale and use of Apple's iPhone 16 and other recent releases, including the Apple Watch Series 10, after the tech giant failed to fulfil its previously agreed investment commitments in the country, as per reports by The Economic Times and 9to5Mac.  This restriction, announced earlier this week, affects not only future sales but also extends to units already in use, posing potential challenges for locals and tourists alike. The ban stems from Apple's shortfall on a pledged $109 million (1.71 trillion rupiah) investment in Indonesia, explains a report by The Economic Times. As part of the country's requirement for foreign companies to meet a 40% local content quota, Apple committed to establishing research and development facilities known as 'Apple academies'. However, the Ministry of Industry reported that Apple had so far invested only $95 million (1.48 trillion rupiah), falling $14 million short of its commitment, according to the report by Apple-centric news platform 9to5Mac. In response to the lack of investment, Indonesia's Ministry of Industry has withheld the necessary IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) certifications required for legal device operation in the country. Without certification, the iPhone 16 models are considered unauthorised, and Industry Minister Gumiwang Kartasasmita has asked the public to report any devices found operating within the nation, further states the 9to5Mac report. While Apple has yet to address the ban publicly, its resolution is critical as Indonesia represents a valuable consumer market in Southeast Asia. The tech community is closely monitoring how Apple responds, given the stakes involved in balancing regulatory compliance with local market access. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
sports,"On the day before a Test match, the common practice in Bangladesh is that the captain of the host team would attend the pre-match press conference. However, that wasn't the case at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram today as skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto, who recently expressed his desire to step down as a captain from all three formats, skipped the press conference ahead of the series-deciding second Test against South Africa, scheduled to start at the same venue tomorrow. Shanto had a long batting practice session at the nets amid hot and humid conditions in Chattogram along with his teammates and the journalists were looking forward to getting him in the press conference after it was reported in several news outlets that Shanto is unwilling to continue as skipper. Shanto, aware of the situation, seemingly skipped the press conference intentionally, which prompted the Bangladesh team management to send left-arm spinner Taijul Islam to attend the press meet. Although the press conference started with some regular questions thrown at him regarding the upcoming Test match, after a while, Taijul had to answer a number of questions regarding Shanto's reluctance to carry on as captain. Initially, Taijul denied speaking on the issue by saying that he hasn't heard anything like that but admitted that some players may face problems with off-field issues cropping up right before a match, something that has become a regular occurrence in Bangladesh cricket over the last one year and so. ""What matters is how the team does [on the field]. Some might get affected by it and some may stay relaxed and just do their own work. Personally, I always try to stay relaxed and try to do my job. But when it happens within a team, I don't know who takes it how. Actually everyone doesn't possess everything the same way,"" Taijul said during the press meet.  ""I really don't have the answer to the question [Shanto leaving captaincy]. Me or other players are not involved in management or board meetings. We are not involved in deciding who will be the captain or coach,"" he said. Taijul also said that if the opportunity arrives, he is ready to take charge of the Test unit. ""As I have been playing for 10 years, I think I'm fully ready,"" Taijul concluded the press meet with a big smile. Some players like pacers Nahid Rana and Hasan Mahmud were missing in today's practice session. Zakir Hasan, who featured in an NCL match for Sylhet against Chattogram, is expected to join the side from Sylhet as soon as the game ends today. Bangladesh are currently trailing the two-match series 1-0 after they lost the opening Test by seven wickets at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium last week. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Nighttime flight operations at Cox's Bazar Airport have been extended until 10:00pm, effective as of yesterday. Previously, the airport remained operational until 7:30pm, said Golam Mortuza Hossain, manager of Cox's Bazar Airport. According to Golam Mortuza, 16 flights operated on the Cox's Bazar-Dhaka route yesterday, with Air Astra and Novoair conducting nighttime flights. He said that with winter approaching, tourist arrivals are expected to rise further due to the increased flight hours. Hossain added that advanced safety and security measures, and necessary technologies for night operations have long been in place at the airport, preparing it for this extension in flight hours. This extension now allows flights between Dhaka and Cox's Bazar to operate later into the evening, facilitating increased travel flexibility for tourists and other passengers. According to people related with tourism business, with this change, visitors can fly from Dhaka in the morning, explore the beach and local attractions, and return on a night flight, boosting convenience and encouraging tourism growth. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Even before the recent change of government in the UK, its role in Bangladesh has been shifting, especially bilaterally. While it remains a funder to basic services and other programmes through its contributions to IFIs and UN agencies, as well as regional programmes and other global initiatives that include Bangladesh, such as the Girls Education Fund and climate change, its bilateral spending has reduced to a 20-year low. According to the Center for Global Development, a think tank based in Washington, DC and London, a further 900 million pounds will have to be diverted this year from the global UK aid budget to spend on asylum seekers in the UK. This represents a diversion of aid from overseas spending to meet domestic asylum pressures while still classifying that spending as ODA. Coincidentally, with Bangladesh approaching the developing country status, its social protection requirements are expected to be met by domestic revenue sources rather than aid. Due to its declining bilateral pot, UK Aid has shifted towards a stronger emphasis on strategic technical assistance to support policy reform—in other words, ideas and methods rather than cash. The UK technical team in Dhaka focuses on strategic priorities like climate change, ongoing Rohingya emergency, gender, poverty among minorities and concerns for their political rights, civil society and conditions for democracy, and macroeconomic policies for growth within the SDG mantra of leaving ""no one behind."" So much for where we are in terms of UK aid to Bangladesh. Given the desire in London for rethinking its position in the world, this is a good time for the interim government in Bangladesh to ""place its order""! At the time of writing, the incoming Labour government has yet to share its approach to overseas aid. There are some hints, however. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has ordered a review of the DFID (i.e. UK Aid) and its current status in the Foreign Office as was. Also in a recent speech, he spoke of how he wants to modernise relationships with the Global South—more partnership, removing the paternalism of the post-colonial past. At the same time, former permanent secretary (2011-17), Sir Mark Lowcock, is about to publish a book with co-author Ranil Dissanayake, titled The Rise and Fall of the Department for International Development, attributing the DFID's ""fall"" to the capture of the UK Conservative Party by its right wing, populist factions. The book will offer proposals to the new incumbents at No.10 as they define the UK's position in a complex international landscape. Exploring that Bangladesh-UK partnership is perhaps easier to do this side of August 5 than before. To me, as an independent observer, it comprises the following elements: expanding geopolitical alliances on key international issues which build on existing collaborations, e.g. over the Rohingya, but also over labour migration rights and protections; reform of global governance institutions (especially re climate change, planetary boundaries, and taxation on international financial transactions as advanced by Tobin); corporate governance and responsibility, i.e. not just referring to the state, or corporate social responsibility, but towards a more acceptable face of capitalism where the accumulation of private profits no longer free rides upon public goods—the RMG sector being a case in point, with its low-waged insecure employees ""subsidising"" low-waged, insecure consumers in the West; and controlling and eliminating corruption—very familiar in Bangladesh, and with implications for the UK; reducing the propensity and need to migrate permanently away from one's own culture, (thereby fracturing family life and identity) by inward combinations of socially progressive FDI and investment in human capital alongside facilitating circular temporary migration to the West or elsewhere; knowledge-building through encouraging university collaborations (as with India in the last decade or so through the UK-India Education and Research Initiative—UKIERI) and student internships and exchanges, perhaps especially within the Bangladeshi diaspora in the UK; investing in gender-balanced secondary education and FE skills provision including access to training and learning opportunities; and sharing HE and FE management approaches as those sectors expand. There are also spreading the principles of inclusive democracy (including the taxation/citizenship nexus, as the underpinning of stakeholding and functional participation); devolution to sub-state political arenas, perhaps necessary in days gone by when communications were difficult, but again necessary for participatory citizenship as it is for the UK; leapfrogging options for Bangladesh in a digital age (e.g. in health, but of course also for inclusive education, especially if the classroom teaching cadre remains underdeveloped); understanding the distribution of poverty between systemic and idiosyncratic explanations, so important for policy choices between fiscal levers and household level intervention; developing well-being indicators, not just income/spending ones, as a guide to policy (for both partners); exploring the state/market boundaries for the regulated pursuit of social objectives; thus understanding the political settlement between rights-based entitlements; philanthropy; voluntarism; not-for-profit services; market opportunities—whether labour or entrepreneurial ones; and support for the Bangladeshi diaspora in the UK, especially youth, and particularly girls. (Aspects of this agenda might constitute an argument for retaining DFID within FCDO to keep diplomacy, development and humanitarian aid in mutual support, though I would regret the loss of cabinet rank for international development, per se. The UK Treasury does have two cabinet rank positions as a model for similar representation in foreign affairs and international development.) No doubt other items could be added to this list. But its main characteristic is that these issues no longer represent the idea of ""aid"" as flowing in one direction, from a rich to poor country within some postcolonial framework of institutionalised philanthropy, combined with an element of self-interest or historical guilt. Rather, this agenda occurs with a genuine framework of mutuality—these issues are shared issues, and sometimes interactive ones. Bangladesh, for example, has much contemporary experience in engaging with poverty and has much practice to share alongside innovative action-research around supporting poor people's entry directly into market opportunities, not just via employment. And as Bangladesh approaches the developing country status, any notion of ""development"" becomes replaced by a notion of ""social policy,"" entailing revenue-funded public intervention derived from rights, not just over-narrow targeting. Both countries, therefore, need to explore together welfare regimes comprising notions of citizens' income, universal basic services, and a Polanyian ""de-commoditisation"" of labour. I have also interacted with sharp minds in Bangladesh around the idea of the smart economy, indeed the smart political economy. There is a sense here in Bangladesh of creative excitement, hence leapfrogging in the list above. At the same time, the UK has institutional baggage to overcome from its own development past in terms of outmoded trading assumptions in a climate-sensitive world, and investment priorities/practices overinfluenced by comparative advantage thinking, which neglect ""decent"" work. Such baggage continues to fuel privileged ""rents"" via regional, class and gender inequalities both globally and within the UK. Bangladesh's future should not be to replicate that institutional baggage, while the UK with its new Labour government should now be trying to discard it. There is a rich partnership agenda. Let's embrace it. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

The ministries are the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and the Ministry of Railways. Adviser of the interim government for these ministries, Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, issued a directive in this regard today. It said that there is shortage of electricity supply in the country and this step will help increase the supply of electricity for irrigation, increase production of fertiliser and raise gas supply to industries. Earlier, a directive was issued to all the ministries of the government to reduce power consumption by 25 percent. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
entertainment,"Timothée Chalamet delighted his fans with an unexpected appearance at a lookalike contest dedicated to him in New York. The event took place in Lower Manhattan, where the Hollywood star surprised attendees by showing up in person. Photos and videos of Chalamet mingling with fans have quickly surfaced across social media, with fans expressing their joy and excitement over the chance to meet the star in such an unexpected setting. Timothée arrived at the event accompanied by bodyguards, making a brief appearance to pose for photos alongside his lookalikes.  Fans at the event embraced the theme, dressing up as various characters the actor has portrayed, with many high-cheekboned, curly-haired attendees channeling his roles from ""Wonka and Dune."" In a viral video circulating online, Chalamet is seen arriving with a smile, sporting a casual ensemble of a blue sweater, pants, and a cap. The ""Dune"" star completed the look with a neatly trimmed moustache. According to a report by AP, the event kicked off at Washington Square Park, where Timothée lookalikes gathered and enjoyed themselves before the police intervened, instructing them to disperse. The organisers were reportedly issued a US $500 fine for holding an ""unauthorised costume contest."" The situation escalated when one participant was escorted away in handcuffs, as noted in the report. The lookalike contest Flyers promoting the lookalike contest had been circulating around New York in recent days, promising a US $50 reward for the best Timothée Chalamet impersonation. Paige Nguyen, a producer working with YouTube personality Anthony Po, who organised the event, shared with AP, ""What began as a lighthearted joke quickly spiraled into chaos."" Initially, the group gathered at Washington Square Park, but after being asked to move, they relocated to a nearby playground. There, more than a dozen contestants took to a makeshift stage, vying for audience approval as they showcased their best Chalamet-inspired looks. The contest concluded with 21-year-old Miles Mitchell being crowned the winner. Dressed in a vibrant purple Willy Wonka costume, Mitchell charmed the audience by playfully tossing candy from a briefcase, embodying the character with flair.

bangladesh,"A teenage boy, who was shot during clashes between armed gangs inside Geneva Camp in the capital's Mohammadpur on Saturday, died while undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital today. Sajjen, 13, also known as Rahmat, breathed his last around 8:30am in the intensive care unit of DMCH, said Inspector Mohammad Faruk, in-charge of the hospital's police outpost. His body has been kept at the DMCH morgue for autopsy. Sajjen used to live with his family in Sector 5 of Geneva Camp. According to locals and police, clashes broke out between several drug-dealing gangs around 5:00pm on Saturday and continued for about three hours, leaving the three people shot. Shamsher Ali, father of Sajjen, said his son went to fetch water from a nearby water pump. ""He was caught in the line of fire and was hit by bullets on his way back home."" Sajjen suffered five bullet wounds in his hand, chest, and abdomen. Initially, he was taken to Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital and was later transferred to DMCH for advanced care. The camp and its adjoining areas have recently become a hotspot of criminal activities such as gunfights, mugging, drug peddling, and murder. On August 6, a day after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, a man named Shahen Shah was shot dead. Another man named Sonu was killed in a major shootout on September 3. On October 17, one Shanemaj, 37, was shot dead during a gunfight between two feuding groups in Geneva Camp. On September 29, a joint team of Bangladesh Army, Rab, and police arrested 35 people, including a top drug dealer, and recovered arms and ammo from the camp. Police and locals say gunfights have been taking place inside the camp almost every day as rival groups are fighting to control the drug sale spots. Many criminals use firearms which were looted from Mohammadpur Police Station during the mass uprising. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

business,"Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus announced new measures to simplify income tax filing in Bangladesh, addressing both individual taxpayers and corporate employees on his official Facebook page today. Taxpayers in Dhaka, Narayanganj, and Gazipur -- including government employees, scheduled bank workers, telecom employees, and officials from several multinational firms -- will now be required to file their returns online under the new initiative, he said. He emphasised the importance of taxes as an economic cornerstone and acknowledged the existing difficulties in submitting tax returns but highlighted imminent changes designed to ease the process.         Read moreNo documents needed to file e-return Others across the country are encouraged to follow suit as part of the government's push toward digital tax administration.      The chief adviser called for a district-wise competition to boost digital tax filing rates, with potential state awards recognising those organisations with high participation. He urged the public to embrace digital filing, especially appealing to young people to assist neighbours and relatives, promoting digital literacy as a stepping stone to future entrepreneurship. ""We are gradually preparing to collect all types of taxes online,"" he said, to make tax compliance easier and more accessible for everyone.        চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
entertainment,"This December, Ziaul Faruq Apurba is set to make his Tollywood debut, while Tareen Jahan returns to the industry with new releases, each starring in their own film. As the Christmas season approaches, these two Bangladeshi stars will go head-to-head at theatres across West Bengal. Apurba's ""Chalchitra"" and Tareen's ""5 No Shopnomoy Lane"" are both scheduled to hit the big screen on December 20. Celebrated actor Apurba enters Tollywood with ""Chalchitra"", directed by Pratim D Gupta. The film is set in Kolkata, where a series of chilling murders of young women sends shockwaves through the city just before the festive season. A team from the Kolkata Police takes up the investigation, soon uncovering disturbing links to an unsolved case from over a decade ago.  Apurba plays a mysterious character who steps in to unravel the dark secrets behind these crimes. In a character reveal, Apurba appears in a striking red kurta, sporting a full beard and a contemplative, inquisitive gaze. Speaking with Ajker Patrika, Apurba shared that he was under strict instructions not to reveal specifics about his character, encouraging viewers to watch the film to uncover the mystery. ""Chalchitra"" also stars Tota Roy Chowdhury, Anirban Chakrabarty, Shantanu Maheshwari, Indrajit Bose, Raima Sen, and Swastika Dutta, among others. On the same day, Tareen's upcoming Tollywood project, ""5 No Shopnomoy Lane"", directed by Manasi Sinha, is set to premiere. This marks Tareen's second collaboration with Sinha, following her Tollywood debut in ""Eta Amader Golpo"", released on April 26. Similar to her previous film, this new project delves into the complexities of human relationships. According to Sinha, the story centres on individuals who find themselves living in isolation due to life circumstances. The title, ""5 No Shopnomoy Lane"", refers to the address of a particular residence, where the lives of its inhabitants unfold. The cast also includes Aparajita Adhya, Kharaj Mukherjee, Chandan Sen, and Arjun Chakraborty, among others. While Apurba and Tareen have established strong careers on the small screen, they have made only a few appearances in Bangladeshi cinema. Tareen's film credits include ""Kajoler Dinratri"" and ""1971: Shei Shob Din"", while Apurba starred in ""Gangster Return"", released in 2015. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
sports,"Former South Africa international Gary Kirsten has resigned as the head coach of Pakistan's ODI and T20I sides just six months into his two-year contract, according to multiple media outlets. Kirsten, who was appointed on April 2024, is stepping down just a day after Mohammad Rizwan was named Pakistan's white-ball captain and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced new central contracts. According to ESPNCricinfo, a rift had been developing between Pakistan's newly-appointed coaches, Kirsten and Jason Gillespie, who coaches them in Tests, and the PCB since the board decided to strip them of selection powers, with that authority exclusively the preserve of a selection committee they would no longer be a part of. After Pakistan lost the first Test against England, a new selection panel - a third in three months - was announced. Aaqib Javed, Aleem Dar, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq and Hassan Cheema were on it, while the coaches and captain were taken off. Gillespie had made little effort to conceal his surprise at the events in the build-up to the third Test in Rawalpindi against England, saying he was now just a ""match-day analyst"", and that ""it wasn't what he signed up for."" Kirsten did not make a public statement but was understood to be disappointed with the developments. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

bangladesh,"The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court today extended its chamber judge's October 2 order that stayed a High Court order granting ad-interim bail to Rana Plaza owner Sohel Rana in a case filed over deaths during the collapse of the factory building in April 2013. The apex court also asked the HC to dispose of in two months the rule that the High Court issued asking the state why Sohel Rana should not be granted permanent bail in the case. The stay order on the HC's ad-interim bail for Sohel will continue till disposal of the rule, and therefore, he cannot get released now, his lawyer Mohammad Shishir Manir told The Daily Star. A three-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam passed the order following a petition filed by the state challenging the HC's ad-interim bail to Sohel Rana. Additional Attorney General Mohammad Arshadur Rauf represented the state during the hearing. Following a bail petition filed by Sohel, the HC on October 1 granted ad-interim bail to him for six months and also issued a rule asking the state to explain why he should not be granted regular bail in this case. At least 1,135 people, mostly garment workers, were killed and over 2,500 others injured as the nine-storey building came crashing down in Savar on April 24, 2013, raising questions about labour and human rights standards in Bangladesh. Wali Ashraf, sub-inspector of Savar Police Station, had filed the murder case, accusing Sohel Rana, a former Jubo League leader, his father and several others, hours after the incident. On May 24, 2015 the Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges against Sohel and 41 others while the Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court framed charges against them on July 18, 2016. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

business,"Boeing is set to launch as early as Monday its plan to raise more than $15 billion in capital, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. Reuters first reported on Oct. 16 that the planemaker was closing in on a plan to raise around $15 billion with common shares and a mandatory convertible bond as it sought to bolster finances worsened by a crippling ongoing strike. The new capital is set to come from a mix of the sale of stock and convertible preferred shares, the source added, saying the total amount raised could rise based on demand. Boeing declined to comment on Sunday. Bloomberg News reported the expected timing of Monday's capital raise earlier. Last week, machinists voted nearly two to one to reject Boeing's latest offer seeking to end the strike that has halted 737 MAX production. The company said earlier this month in regulatory filings that it could raise as much as $25 billion in stock and debt with its investment-grade credit rating at risk. The aerospace giant has been dealing with increased regulatory scrutiny, production curbs and a loss of confidence from customers since a door panel blew off a 737 MAX plane in midair in early January. Boeing has been burning through cash all year and last week announced a new $6 billion quarterly loss. Earlier this month, Boeing said it had secured a $10 billion credit agreement with major lenders: Bank of America , Citibank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan . Boeing said earlier this month it would cut 17,000 jobs - 10 percent of its global workforce - and delay first deliveries of its 777X jet by a year. The top three credit rating agencies - S&P, Moody's and Fitch - have said they will cut Boeing's ratings to junk if it raised new debt without retiring some $11 billion of debt maturing through Feb. 1, 2026. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"Oil prices tumbled Monday with markets relieved that Israel's strikes on Iran had avoided the country's energy infrastructure while the yen fell to a three-month low after Japan's ruling party suffered an election drubbing. Israel carried out air strikes on military sites in Iran on Saturday in response to Tehran's October 1 missile barrage, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Iran has downplayed the attack, saying it caused ""limited damage"" to a few radar systems, signalling what analysts say is the Islamic republic's reluctance to escalate further. Oil prices fell as much as five percent in early trade before paring some of their losses. ""Israel's strike, carefully avoiding energy sites, has softened fears of a full-scale conflict with Iran,"" said Stephen Innes, analyst at SPI Asset Management. ""Even more telling is Iran's response, downplaying the attack's impact and signaling that its warnings may have deterred any more aggressive action from Israel,"" he said. ""If tensions cool further or peace talks unexpectedly gain traction, we could see oil slide down to $60 per barrel as traders shift focus back to the looming 2025 supply glut—especially if China's economic stimulus underwhelms,"" Innes added. Concerns about the outlook for the world's largest oil importer have added to the downward pressure on crude prices, with observers waiting for headline figures on Beijing's stimulus plan to support the wavering Chinese economy. Investors are looking for details of any major stimulus package to be unveiled after the conclusion of a key political meeting in Beijing next week, which coincides with the US presidential election. On currency markets the yen hit a three-month low, sliding more than one percent against the dollar as Japan's ruling coalition was projected to lose its majority in a general election. New Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's gamble calling snap elections appeared to have backfired badly, with his Liberal Democratic Party projected to have fallen short of an absolute majority on its own for the first time since 2009. Mid-morning, one dollar bought 153.88 yen, the Japanese currency's lowest value since late July. In Japan the cost of living has become a political issue, Rodrigo Catril at National Australia Bank said on the Morning Call podcast. ""The general sense is that there's a risk here that the government will have to concede in terms of its fiscal discipline agenda, so in order to get more people to join the coalition, they will have to become a little more fiscally loose,"" he said. ""At the same time there's a risk there that support for policy normalisation for the government, in terms of the Bank of Japan policy normalisation, it may be that the LDP may not be able to be as supportive of the Bank of Japan's process. So that's the major concern particularly from the central bank perspective."" The BoJ lifted rates in March for the first time in 17 years as it moved away from its long-running ultra-loose monetary policy. A surprise second lift in July sparked turmoil in markets. The yen's weakness boosted Japanese shares, as exporters benefit from a cheaper currency, with Tokyo up 1.5 percent. Asian markets were mostly higher, with Shanghai, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila all in the green while Hong Kong, Taipei, Jakarta retreated. Sydney and Singapore were flat. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
entertainment,"Bollywood's celebrated producer-director Mahesh Bhatt recently made a surprise visit to Bangladeshi superstar Shakib Khan on the set of his latest film, ""Borbaad"", at Mumbai's Ellora Studio.  Shakib has been shooting there for the past few days, and just next door was Bhatt, who shares a strong bond with Shailesh Awasthhi, the cinematographer of Borbaad"". After learning from Shailesh that Shakib Khan was filming nearby, Bhatt decided to drop by. His visit was a delightful surprise, as he spent around 20 minutes with the Dhallywood superstar, engaging in a warm conversation centred around cinema.  Shakib's manager, Monir Zaman, shared that Bhatt expressed deep interest in Bangladesh's film industry, hinting at potential collaborations between the two nations. Before departing, Bhatt embraced Shakib in a heartfelt moment that has since gone viral. A photo of the embrace, widely shared on social media, has fueled discussions across film-related groups. While efforts were made to reach Shakib Khan, he was unavailable due to his busy shooting schedule. ""Mahesh Bhatt sat with Shakib and discussed how cinema can bridge ties between Bangladesh and India,"" Monir added. ""Bhatt's family's legacy in Indian cinema is vast, and his interest in Bangladesh's film scene is truly encouraging. Who knows, something remarkable might come of this. He even invited Shakib for a future meeting."" The Bollywood stalwart also made time to meet each Bangladeshi crew member on set, greeting them with his characteristic warmth and humour. Shakib Khan arrived in Mumbai on October 22 for ""Borbaad"", directed by Mehedi Hasan. Filming began on October 24, and the initial shooting phase will continue until November 10.  While ""Borbaad"" marks Hasan's debut as a director, he is already a prominent actor with over a hundred TV dramas to his name.

entertainment,"In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Johnny Depp shared his thoughts on the public backlash he faced, revealing that despite the tumultuous period, he harbours no ill feelings toward anyone. After enduring years of intense media scrutiny and legal battles, particularly around his high-profile divorce from Amber Heard, the actor is now focused on his future, not old grudges.  Now back in the director's chair for his upcoming film, ""Modi: Three Days on the Wing of Madness"", Depp is ready to move forward.  Reflecting on his life, Depp acknowledged how the media circus turned his personal struggles into a public spectacle. He recalled a time when it seemed as if ""everybody was against me."" However, Depp explained that he no longer dwells on the negativity. ""Honestly, I can sit here this very second and think about all the hit pieces, and how everybody was against me, and yeah yeah yeah, he is off the map … endless stuff. I can remember it all. Went through it all,"" Depp said.  ""Some of it was not the most beautiful time, some of it was hilarious. Some of it was mad. The thing is, it simply just was, and it simply just is. So, for me, it happened. I learned, man."" Depp emphasised that every experience, whether positive or painful, offers a lesson. Despite the hardships, he refuses to let resentment linger. ""I don't have any ill feelings toward anyone. I don't have this great reserve of hatred, because hatred requires caring. Why carry that baggage?"" Depp's latest film, set in 1916 Paris, focuses on three turbulent days in the life of the iconic Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. The actor was recently honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Rome Film Festival, where ""Modi"" premiered. This project marks Depp's return to directing after a long hiatus. Earlier this year, Depp's last film, ""Jeanne du Barry"", premiered in US theatres, where he portrayed King Louis XV. Depp's legal saga, involving a defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard, dominated headlines for months. After winning the case, Heard was ordered to pay him US $10 million in compensatory damages and US $350,000 in punitive damages. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"Bangladesh, a nation with a rapidly growing economy and a thriving garment export sector, is facing a critical juncture in its energy policy. Our increasing reliance on imported fossil fuels—petroleum, coal, and liquefied natural gas (LNG)—for electricity production and primary energy consumption is creating significant economic challenges. These challenges threaten the stability of our finances, placing additional strain on the country's balance of payments and foreign currency reserves, and impact our ability to remain competitive in the global market, particularly in the garment sector, which is a vital contributor to the nation's economy. Importing large volumes of fossil fuels exacerbates these financial pressures, driving up energy costs for consumers and businesses alike. Fossil fuels are a concern for the export-driven ready-made garment (RMG) sector too because global fashion brands, which source much of their apparel from Bangladesh, are increasingly demanding that their suppliers reduce carbon emissions across the supply chain. If Bangladesh fails to act, we risk losing our competitive edge in the global market, where sustainability is becoming a non-negotiable criterion. To address these challenges, Bangladesh should shift its focus towards energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energy sources. Doing so will not only reduce our reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports but also help lower emissions, improve energy security, and enhance the competitiveness of the RMG sector in an environmentally conscious marketplace. Interestingly, speakers at the recent Bangladesh Climate Action Forum 2024 discussed policy interventions that can help address these challenges and ensure a sustainable future by promoting renewable energy and enhancing energy efficiency. Five policy recommendations critical to this transition are discussed below. One of the key barriers to energy efficiency upgrades is the high equipment cost. To encourage businesses to adopt energy-saving technologies, the government should reduce duties on specific equipment such as high-efficiency (IE4 or IE5) fans and motors, steam system accessories, and solar system components. Businesses will be more likely to invest in upgrades that reduce their overall energy consumption if the upfront costs of energy-efficient technologies are reduced. Also, it should be considered whether the current tax rate for solar panels and solar equipment can be reduced to zero.   Bangladesh should shift its focus towards energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energy sources. Doing so will not only reduce our reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports but also help lower emissions, improve energy security, and enhance the competitiveness of the RMG sector in an environmentally conscious marketplace.      Tax breaks for companies that implement energy efficiency projects can further incentivise businesses. This could be achieved through accelerated capital allowances, which would allow businesses to deduct the cost of energy efficiency upgrades more quickly. Net metering allows businesses that generate their own renewable energy, such as solar power, to sell excess electricity back to the grid. However, facilities within the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) are currently unable to take advantage of net metering, making it difficult for them to justify investing in renewable energy. Net metering in these zones would help companies also contribute to the country's renewable energy capacity. Additionally, prohibiting the shutdown of solar systems on weekends and holidays would prevent the waste of freely generated electricity. Access to financing is a major obstacle for businesses seeking to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. While some financing options exist, they are often difficult to access due to high interest rates and complicated application processes. The government should work with development financial institutions (DFIs) and other partners to create more accessible and affordable financing options. This could include low-interest loans and guarantees for specific risks such as currency fluctuations and credit defaults, which would encourage more businesses to invest in clean energy.         Read moreBangladesh on the renewable energy race track A comprehensive revision of the IEPMP is essential to ensure that Bangladesh can rapidly increase its renewable energy capacity. The government should set ambitious targets for renewable energy integration and develop clear implementation strategies to achieve these goals. One way to fast-track renewable energy adoption is through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs), which would allow businesses to enter into long-term agreements to purchase renewable energy directly from producers. This would create a stable market for renewable energy and encourage further investment in the sector. Bangladesh is at a critical crossroads in its energy policy. By implementing the proposed policy interventions, we can secure a bright economic future, reduce our carbon footprint, and maintain our competitive edge in the global RMG market. The time to act is now, and the benefits of transitioning to a more sustainable energy system will be felt for generations to come.  Mostafiz Uddin is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

asia,"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition fell short of his declared ""victory line"" of a majority in snap parliamentary elections, media projections showed Monday. AFP examines the options now for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after its worst result since 2009, and the prospects for its bruised leader Ishiba, who only took office on October 1. - Why the big loss? - Fiercely critical of former prime minister Shinzo Abe and his brand of establishment politics, Ishiba has long played on his relative popularity with voters as the LDP's ""intraparty foe"". But while this won him the party leadership, in the election citizens were more interested in punishing the LDP over a scandal that saw party members pocket money from fund-raisers. That the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) recently elected moderately conservative former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as leader also didn't help. Briefly in office between 2011 and 2012, and known for his ""realistic"" stance, ""I think the majority of Japanese people trust Noda"", said Masato Kamikubo, a politics professor at Ritsumeikan University. ""He is a very stable politician"", Kamikubo said. While the LDP's seats as projected by public broadcaster NHK tumbled to 191, from 259 seats at the last election, the CDP's tally soared to 148 from 96. Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner, slipped to 24 from 32, with new party chief Keiichi Ishii losing his seat. - Could the opposition form a government? - This is tricky given the fragmented opposition, and memories of its tumultuous rule between 2009 and 2012, analysts say. ""The possibility of a handover of power to the opposition isn't zero, but there are far too many opposition parties for any of them to reach a majority,"" said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo. Policy differences and past fallings-out continue to divide and hobble opposition parties, from communists to the liberal CDP, the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP) and the ""reformist conservative"" Japan Innovation Party. - Can Ishiba find new partners? - The prime minister has his work cut out to make it happen. On the campaign trail, CDP leader Noda said it would be ""impossible"" to join forces with the LDP, having been part of previous no-confidence votes. The Japan Innovation Party also remains unconvinced, with its head Nobuyuki Baba dismissing a tie-up with the LDP in its current scandal-tainted state as ""impossible"". The centrist DPP, too, denied it would sign up for the coalition. But its leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, left open the possibility of a ""partial coalition"" where it can offer some flexibility on individual policies it has an affinity with. - What about Ishiba's future? - Ishiba will likely therefore have to resort to heading a minority administration, seeking support from other parties on a case-by-case basis. But this is likely to destabilise Ishiba's nascent power base, and leave him susceptible to challenges from within his own party. Speculation is growing that Ishiba may be forced to resign to take responsibility for the debacle -- becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in Japan's post-war history. In a nuanced denial of this prospect, though, Ishiba on Sunday night answered in the affirmative when asked by a reporter whether the prime minister intends to follow through on his duties. ""If the ruling coalition or even just the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba will face harsh criticism from party members"", Yosuke Sunahara of Kobe University told AFP before Sunday. But at the same time, the ruling coalition's loss of a majority in the Lower House only goes to lay bare public disenchantment with the political funding scandal. So if ""Ishiba is ousted while the party tries to gloss over the issue, public backlash against the LDP will intensify,"" Sunahara said. ""This makes it difficult for Ishiba's rivals within the party to criticise him."" সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"Courts, bullets and verbal stumbles have made their mark on this year's US election campaign -- one of the most extraordinary in the nation's history. Here are five key moments so far as candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris edge towards Election Day on November 5. - Trump the felon - ""Trump Guilty,"" is splashed across the world's front pages. On May 30 the Republican becomes the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes -- 34 counts to be exact. He is found to have falsified business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of his 2016 election win, so that she would not publicize their alleged sexual encounter. In the explosive six-week trial, Daniels shares excruciating details about their apparent one-night stand, including the sex position and Trump's silky pajamas. The ordeal pulls him from the campaign trail, but huge media attention ensures he keeps the spotlight -- even if it is on his criminality. Nothing in US law prevents Trump from running for the White House after the guilty verdict, and Republicans double down their unwavering support for the party standard-bearer, who still faces three other criminal cases. - Debate drama - Democratic hopes appear shattered after President Joe Biden, the party's presumptive nominee, delivers a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump on June 27. The 81-year-old fumbles his words and often appears to forget what he is saying, bolstering fears that he is not fit to run again for president. Biden brushes it off as a ""bad night"" but dissenters say otherwise, with donors threatening to pull funding if he does not step aside. Post-debate polling shows Trump pulling away from Biden but the White House insists there is zero chance he will withdraw. - Assassination attempt - A sun-baked Trump rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 provides the election campaign's most shocking moment yet. Popping sounds ring out, Trump touches his ear, sees blood, and drops to the stage floor. Secret Service officers surround him as screams ring out in the crowd. Within seconds Trump is helped back to his feet. ""Fight, fight, fight!"" he mouths to a now cheering audience, raising his fist to create one of the most iconic images in US political history. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, is shot dead at the scene by the Secret Service, and Trump survives with a minor graze to his right ear. Trump's base is galvanized. ""I took a bullet for democracy,"" he tells his supporters at a later rally.         Read moreBeyonce v Joe Rogan: stars power up US election - Biden says 'bye' - At 1.46 pm on Sunday, July 21, a beleaguered President Biden announces in a tweet that he will not seek reelection, yielding to intense concerns over his ability to defeat Trump in November. It makes him the first sitting president since 1968 not to seek reelection, and upends the White House race. Kamala Harris, the first female, Black and Asian-American to serve as US vice president, gains Biden's endorsement to replace him in the campaign. Within two weeks she formally secures the Democratic nomination, making her the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket. Harris re-energizes Democrats and delivers immediate results in opinion polls by clawing back Trump's gains, including in the election-deciding swing states. - Trump's second scare - Trump's weekend round of golf in Florida on September 15 is shattered by the sound of gunshots -- this time fired by a Secret Service agent foiling what the FBI calls an apparent assassination attempt. The Republican nominee is unharmed in the second such scare in two months. Investigators say the gunman, Ryan Routh, did not shoot at Trump but instead fled when a security agent opened fire after seeing his rifle pointing through a tree line at the golf course. Trump attributes the assassination scare to the allegedly provocative ""rhetoric"" of Biden and Harris. The Democrats say they condemn political violence, but the incident highlights the volatility of US politics just weeks before voters head to the polls.  চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

Through a new partnership with Uber, Waymo's footprint will also grow into Austin and Atlanta, said the company in a Reuters report on the matter. The fresh investment aligns with Alphabet's long-term plan to inject $5 billion into Waymo over several years, a strategy outlined by Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat in July. According to Reuters, Waymo has steadily progressed in the autonomous vehicle landscape, amassing millions of testing miles and securing regulatory permits, including one from the California Public Utilities Commission in 2022, which was a key milestone in California's highly regulated market for ride-hailing services. This funding shows growing confidence in Waymo's autonomous ride-hailing ambitions despite regulatory scrutiny and industry-wide scepticism, suggests the Reuters report. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
world,"US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November 5 election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history. And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a week before Election Day. Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president. Under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of ""electors,"" based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote. With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested ""swing states"" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates. This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and every one is a toss-up within the margin of error. Here is a look: Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes)  Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.        Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. Known for its ""Rust Belt"" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base. Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state, where the pair held their one and only presidential debate. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally in Pennsylvania, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns. Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents. Georgia (16) This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers. Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to ""find"" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory. But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election. Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia. North Carolina (16)  The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play. The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats. Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race. As in neighboring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.         Read moreHarris, Obama push early voting in tight race Michigan (15) Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community. But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Arizona (11)  The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes. Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favor. Harris visited Arizona's border in September vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump ""tanked"" for political purposes. Wisconsin (10)  Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign. As with Midwestern neighbor Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats. Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there. While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has made the state race a nailbiter. Nevada (6)  The Silver State, with a population of 3.1 million, hasn't voted Republican since 2004. Conservatives, buoyed by Trump's headway with Hispanic voters, are convinced they can flip the script. Trump held a significant lead here against Biden. But within weeks of becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris -- promoting her economic plans to help small businesses and combat inflation -- has erased that advantage in the western state, whose largest city Las Vegas is dominated by the hospitality industry.      সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

world,"Things are tight at the top of the ICC World Test Championship standings with just 15 percent separating the top five teams. India and Australia remain in the top two spots on the standings and a repeat of the memorable 2023 final at The Oval remains a distinct possibility. But the likes of Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Africa remain in contention of claiming a coveted top two spot on the standings and earning a place at next year's one-off Test at Lord's. World Test Championship Standings First - India - 62.82% of possible points Remaining series: New Zealand (home, one Test), Australia (away, five Tests) Best possible finish: 74.56% The two-time World Test Championship runners up were looking pretty for a place at next year's final, but consecutive slip-ups at home against New Zealand has left the door open for opposition sides. While Rohit Sharma's team still maintains a narrow lead at the top of the standings, another loss in the third Test against the Black Caps will see them travel to Australia next month needing to win at least four of their matches Down Under to ensure qualification. Regardless of what happens in Mumbai against New Zealand, the five-match series against Australia at the end of the year will be pivotal for India and their chances of reaching a third straight World Test Championship final. Second - Australia - 62.50% of possible points Remaining series: India (home, five Tests), Sri Lanka (away, two Tests) Best possible finish: 76.32% Reigning World Test Championship winners Australia are on track for a second consecutive appearance in the final, but Pat Cummins' side will likely still need to win a minimum of four of their remaining seven Tests if they are to defend the title they won in 2023. The one advantage that Australia have over India is they have two Tests in Sri Lanka next year, meaning they could theoretically draw 2-2 with Rohit Sharma's side and stay in contention for a place in the final ahead of that trip to Asia. But first things first for Australia, who have a poor recent record at home against India and will be keen to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in over a decade. Remaining World Test Championship Fixtures Third - Sri Lanka - 55.56% of possible points Remaining Series: South Africa (away, Two Tests), Australia (home, two Tests) Best Possible Finish: 69.23% A head-turning victory over England in the third Test in England means Sri Lanka could still make a push for a World Test Championship Final berth with three more wins from their remaining four Tests. Their task will be difficult, with two Tests scheduled in South Africa at the end of November and a further two-match series at home against reigning champions Australia in 2025. If Sri Lanka can pinch one victory in South Africa, it could lead to a grandstand finish on home soil with the top two spots potentially still to be decided in the final series of the cycle. Fourth - New Zealand - 50% of possible points Remaining series: India (away, one Test), England (home, three Tests) Best possible finish: 64.29% Winning a first-ever series in India has given New Zealand some hope of claiming a second World Test Championship title, but they still have plenty of work to do if they are to finish in the top two places on the standings. The Black Caps will likely need to win all four of their remaining Tests to make it through to the final, meaning they will have to complete series sweeps over India (they have already won two Tests on the trot there) and England at home if they are to do so. It's not impossible, but will be tough going for the Kiwis. Fifth - South Africa - 47.62% of possible points Remaining series: Bangladesh (away, one Test), Sri Lanka (home, two Tests), Pakistan (home, two Tests) Best possible finish: 69.44% A first win in the sub-continent for more than 10 years has given South Africa hope of reaching next year's World Test Championship final, but they will likely need to replicate that success in the second Test against Bangladesh and then win three of their four contests on home soil at the end of the year. The two-match home series against Sri Lanka at the end of November will be the crucial one for the Proteas, as a series-sweep there will boost their own chances of reaching the final and put an end to any hopes the island nation had of reaching the title decider. South Africa are a genuine threat to the top teams on the standings given they have four more matches at home, but getting that second consectivie triumph in Bangladesh is also going to be pivotal for their prospects. Sixth - England - 40.79% of possible points Remaining series: New Zealand (away, three Tests) Best possible finish: 48.86% Consecutive losses in Pakistan has seen England drop out of contention for a spot at next year's final, with Ben Stokes' side with just three more Tests remaining this cycle. They travel to New Zealand for a three-match series against the Black Caps and will be looking to finish the cycle on a good note with a series victory away from home. Seventh - Pakistan - 33.33% of possible points Remaining Series: South Africa (away, two Tests), West Indies (home, two Tests) Best Possible Finish: 52.38% Pakistan have won back-to-back Tests under the watchful eye of new coach Jason Gillespie, but remain out of contention of reaching the final with a total of six teams ahead of them on the standings. While Pakistan could still win their remaining four Tests and finish with a percentage as high as 52.38 percent, this is unlikely to be enough to finish in the top two places on the standings. to New Zealand for a three-match series against the Black Caps and will be looking to finish the cycle on a good note with a series victory away from home.  Behind the scenes at Pakistan training with Babar Azam and former star Ramiz Raja as the team prepares for the crunch clash against India at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 Eighth - Bangladesh - 30.56% of possible points Remaining Series: South Africa (home, one Test), West Indies (away, two Tests) Best Possible Finish: 47.92% The recent loss to South Africa at home put pay to Bangladesh's chances of reaching next year's final, with just three Tests remaining for the Asian side this cycle. They could still win those three matches to finish with a percentage of 47.92, but this won't be enough to feature in a first World Test Championship final. Ninth - West Indies - 18.52% of possible points Remaining Series: Bangladesh (home, two matches), Pakistan (away, two matches) Best Possible Finish: 43.59% Outside a moment of glory against Australia in Brisbane in early 2024, it's been a forgettable second World Test Championship cycle for the West Indies. The men from the Caribbean dropped 20 of a possible 24 points in their home stand against India to begin the campaign, and lost the first Test in Australia by 10 wickets before the unlikely win at the Gabba in January. Kraigg Brathwaite's men were unable to emulate the same success in England, losing all three matches heavily, before dropping 20 points in a home series against South Africa. After their home series in Bangladesh at the end of November, the West Indies face Pakistan away early in the new year to round out their campaign. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
business,"The Bangladesh Bank (BB) governor has accused tycoons linked to the former administration of Sheikh Hasina of collaborating with members of the country's military intelligence agency to siphon $17 billion from the banking sector during her rule. In an interview with the Financial Times, BB Governor Ahsan H Mansur claimed that the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) had facilitated forced takeovers of leading banks. Mansur estimated that Tk 2 lakh crore, or $16.7 billion, was moved out of Bangladesh after these takeovers through methods such as loans issued to the new shareholders and inflated import invoices. ""This is the largest, most significant bank robbery by any international standard,"" he said.  ""It hasn't happened on this scale anywhere else, and it was state-sponsored. This couldn't have occurred without intelligence officers pressuring [former bank CEOs]."" The governor specifically named Mohammed Saiful Alam, founder and chairman of the industrial conglomerate S Alam Group, and his associates, alleging they had ""siphoned off"" at least $10 billion from the banking system after taking control of banks with DGFI support. ""Every day, they were granting loans to themselves,"" Mansur noted in the interview. Responding through a statement issued by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan on behalf of Saiful Alam, the S Alam Group denied Mansur's allegations, calling them baseless, according to the FT. ""The interim government's coordinated campaign against the S Alam Group and several other prominent businesses in Bangladesh has disregarded even basic principles of due process,"" the statement read.  ""This has already shaken investor confidence and contributed to the deterioration of law and order. Given the group's record and contributions, we find the governor's accusations surprising and unjustified."" The Inter Services Public Relations Directorate, which manages media inquiries for Bangladesh's armed forces, did not respond to requests for comment. The DGFI was also unavailable for comment, FT reported. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "

sports,"The elite of world football will gather in Paris on Monday for the Ballon d'Or ceremony, with Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior the leading candidate for the men's award and Barcelona's Aitana Bonmati the hot favourite to win her second-successive crown. The men's shortlist for the 2023/24 edition of the prestigious individual award is the first since 2003 to feature neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo who hoovered up the prize 13 times between them. Vinicius, the man who inherited Ronaldo's number seven shirt at Real Madrid, has been tipped by many pundits to succeed Messi as the Men's Ballon d'Or after a season in which he won the Spanish championship and Champions League. ""Vinicius is going to win (the Ballon d'Or),"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti declared after his player netted a hat-trick in a 5-2 Champions League win against Borussia Dortmund last week. ""And not because of the three goals but because of his character. He's extraordinary."" If the 24-year-old Brazilian showed why he is expected to take Messi's crown in Madrid's stunning comeback midweek, he was less influential in Saturday's La Liga Clasico as Real were comprehensively beaten 4-0 by Barcelona. But Vinicius' six goals last term were vital as Madrid lifted their 15th Champions League, with the attacker scoring a brace in the semi-final and a goal in the final. Vinicius has also become a figurehead in the fight against racism after being targeted on numerous occasions since arriving in Spain in 2018. He earned worldwide support in May 2023 when he squared off with Valencia supporters after suffering abuse at their Mestalla Stadium. The players expected to challenge Vinicius for the Ballon d'Or are club-mate and England star Jude Bellingham, as well as Manchester City and Spain's Euro 2024-winning midfield general Rodri. Also among the list of nominees are goal machines Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe. Real Madrid right-back Dani Carvajal has an outside shot, after a season which saw him lift the treble of La Liga, Champions League and European Championship. In the Women's Ballon d'Or, 26-year-old Barcelona and Spain playmaker Bonmati is expected to retain the title she claimed for the first time last season. She was again the outstanding player in a team which won its first continental quadruple of domestic league and cup, Spanish Supercopa and Champions League. Barcelona's dominance of the women's game is reflected in the number of nominees the Catalan club boasts, with attackers Caroline Graham Hansen and Salma Paralluelo considered the two principal threats to their club-mate Bonmati. The Ballon d'Or ceremony will take place in the centre of Paris on Monday where the winners, as decided by an international jury of football journalists, will be announced. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Some economic growth projections have been made for Bangladesh considering its current economic realities. In the latest projections, the World Bank has forecasted that the economic growth of Bangladesh for the fiscal year 2024-25 would be 4.1 percent. Earlier, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) growth projection for Bangladesh for the same fiscal year has been 5.1 percent. These indicate three things: first, the numbers reflect the current economic realities of the country; second, even though there are differences in numbers, both the organisations have downgraded their earlier growth projections; and, three, economic growth projections have been made only by international organisations, but not by national entities. The Bangladesh economy has shown some weaknesses in the last fiscal year and that has been reflected in the projections by the above organisations. For example, the ADB's forecast for economic growth for the current fiscal year has been downgraded from 6.6 percent to 5.1 percent. Similarly, the World Bank has downgraded its projection for the Bangladesh economy from 5.7 percent to 4.1 percent. The sluggishness in Bangladesh's economic growth has three dimensions—the legacy of global events during the last three to four years, the happenings in the Bangladesh economy in the recent past, and the current events in the country. In this context, it is pertinent to note that non-economic factors highly impact economic growth, even though economic forces mainly drive it, and future growth potentials must be discussed along with current growth patterns. There is no denying the fact that like other economies of the world, global events over the past three to four years have affected the growth prospects of Bangladesh. Covid has paralysed the global economy as well as Bangladesh. It impacted the domestic economy, where the lives and livelihoods of people were at stake. Diversion of public resources to tackle the pandemic shrunk resources for both productive and social sectors, and Covid affected Bangladeshi exports to the outer world. For example, the RMG industry of Bangladesh was severely affected because of Covid. All these factors impacted the country's growth trend. Next came the Ukraine war, which disrupted the global supply chain. As a result, food and energy prices went up considerably. Since Bangladesh is a food and energy importing country, the global commodity price hikes have contributed to the domestic inflationary pressures, adversely affecting the country's growth prospects. Besides, the economic growth scenario during the tenure of the last government should be analysed in terms of two issues. First, the reliability and the robustness of the growth data—so many official growth figures used to float around, with so many revisions and projections that trusting one single number for any fiscal year became quite difficult. Added to this was the multiplicity of growth data published by various official entities. Second, the economic mismanagement by the past government also made the country's economic growth quite volatile. Discretionary decisions at the state-level; crises in the banking sector in terms of defaulting loans, bad loans, and money laundering; and the absence of transparency and accountability in economic decisions and implementation have led to widespread corruption, economic uncertainties and different instabilities in the economy. Naturally, economic growth could neither thrive nor sustain under such circumstances. The current political structure has inherited an economy with huge challenges. The present state of the economy needs to be fixed as there are volatilities and instabilities. Fortunately, some declining trends have improved. For example, remittance flows have surged, foreign exchange reserves have improved, money laundering has been mostly halted, and exchange rates have stabilised. In the banking sector, measures have been taken to assist failing banks, to reconstitute the management structure of the banks, and to restore the faith and trust of the people in the banking system. Yet, in the present economy, there are both economic and non-economic reasons, which have slowed the economic growth in Bangladesh. On the economic front, continued high inflation has impacted the growth rate adversely. The inflation rate still remains near 10 percent. This rate is high compared to our neighbours. Over the past two years, Sri Lanka has been able to reduce its inflation rate from 70 percent to less than one percent. Even if the global inflation rate is on a downward trend, the inflation rate in Bangladesh is stuck at a high level for quite some time. High inflation erodes economic growth. There has been a deceleration in economic activities for various reasons and economic activities are yet to be optimal. For example, the production in the RMG industry is yet to reach its normal level. Industrial production in other sectors has to recover from the disruptions, it has gone through. As there are economic uncertainties, both domestic and foreign investments are not coming in as desired. The banking sector is still not in good shape. The law and the order situation face different vulnerabilities. As a result, there seem to be fewer growth opportunities. The recent floods, on one hand, have destroyed the lives and livelihoods of people as well as the wealth of households, and on the other, they have adversely impacted the production base of the affected areas. Even though the exact impact of the floods on the growth prospects is yet to be clear, the widespread floods in a vast area of Bangladesh are expected to affect the economy's future growth. A deceleration of economic growth will shrink the economy and impact the country's social sector. The overall economic impacts would depend on the sectors which experience the maximum effects. Over time, the manufacturing sector has led to jobless growth, not leading to any new job creation. Under such a circumstance, a sluggish industrial sector may not result in large employment losses, while a slowdown in service sectors may have significant impacts on people's jobs and income. With high inflation and declining growth, social sectors such as healthcare, and education would be adversely affected. In the process, the poor and the marginalised would be affected the most. These are the current realities of the Bangladesh economy. But even with all the uncertainties, volatilities and instabilities, the economy is expected to overcome all the growth hindrances in the coming days. With the continued improvements in the economic management on all frontiers, the Bangladesh economy is expected to be on an enhanced growth trajectory, with the trust and the confidence of the people on a solid base, higher investments both by local and foreign investors, and further improvements in the law and the order situations in the country. Reforms in the banking sector, stable policies in the external trade sector, and ensuring stability in the manufacturing sector would contribute to the process. If the supply of agricultural inputs including seeds and fertilisers is ensured, the agricultural sector may hold on to its past growth rates of four percent. In the ultimate analysis, if Bangladesh's economy achieves a growth rate of about five percent, that would be considered favourable under the present circumstances. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Politicians' goals for basic education in South Asia are different from parents' goals. Politicians want school construction, teacher recruitment, free textbooks, and a centralised system of education. Parents want a quality education that gives their children a better future. It's no surprise, then, to see a consistent increase among parents in South Asia sending their children to non-government schools (""low cost"" private schools, NGO schools, madrasas) with the hope that their children will learn, at a minimum, the ability to read the local language at a basic level and do basic arithmetic. But even in these modest desires, we believe both the children and their parents are betrayed by South Asian school systems—with the exception of Sri Lanka. For example, the ""learning poverty"" rates in the three most populous countries in South Asia range from 56 percent in India and 58 percent in Bangladesh, to 78 percent in Pakistan. The outlier is Sri Lanka where the rate is only 14 percent, better than many high-income countries. Why is this the case given that, over the last three decades, there has been near universal access to primary education? To understand this, you have to appreciate that school systems are composed of institutions dominated by the education bureaucracy, by politicians, and by teachers' unions. The dominant goal of those groups is not children's learning, but the protection of their own interests.         Read moreAn education memorandum Gaming the system Politicians see education as a tool to foster a common allegiance and national loyalty among citizens. That's why bureaucrats and politicians have gamed universal primary education in various ways. In 2009, India enacted an ambitious Right to Education Act for all children aged 6-14 years. At the same time, Bangladesh introduced the Primary Education Completion Examination (PECE). Both initiatives resulted in higher enrolment and a higher primary cycle graduation, but not better learning. The most credible assessment of primary students' learning in India is ASER, a large-scale assessment conducted at students' homes with a statistically significant sample size. It's organised by Pratham, a large NGO. The most advanced questions posed are on the ability of sampled children to read a short story at Grade 2 level and divide a three-digit number by a one-digit number. The national averages of the latest ASER survey, in 2022, are dismal. At Grade 5, in government schools 39 percent of children can read the story and 22 percent can do the division. Though far from ideal, non-government schools perform much better: at Grade 5, about 57 percent can read the story and 37 percent can do the division.      But, this begs the question: why are children successfully graduating from school but can neither comprehend a Grade-2-level passage or solve a simple division problem? The ""game"" in Bangladesh and India has been to lower the bar to pass the Grade 5 exam, and to frequently allow question paper leakage before the exam day.         Read moreEquip teachers to bring positive changes in education As an example, for more than a decade, Bangladesh conducted the National Student Assessment (NSA), a very sophisticated in-school assessment on a representative sample of primary school students in grades 3 and 5. But, in 2022, Bangladesh compromised assessment integrity by offering special tutoring to Grade 5 students using the testing tools to demonstrate better performance in their latest NSA. Ironically, the national entity that oversees primary education service delivery played this ""game"" instead of protecting the integrity of the assessment. The international organisation that oversaw the 2022 NSA collaborated with the primary education department in Bangladesh and failed to protect minimum research integrity. In Bangladesh, despite this kind of scam, international organisations have played an important role in expanding primary education opportunities for millions of children. Like many other developing countries, Bangladesh has received significant development assistance in education since the 1980s, following the elevation of education as an investment emanating from the Jomtien conference in Thailand and the subsequent Education for All commitment to universal primary education. After 1990, Bangladesh started receiving more development assistance in education. Politicians and bureaucrats used the money to create more positions for more teachers, build more classrooms, distribute free textbooks to all primary school students, and expand teacher training facilities. Everything improved except actual learning. After the Jomtien conference, the bureaucracy and politicians met their desires; the parents did not.         Read moreThe problem is not with coaching centres or ChatGPT. It's with our education system. Education as investment—for whom? Around the world, national governments and multilateral and bilateral organisations have initiated development programmes aimed at alleviating poverty. In this development effort, education has always been considered as the single most important means for increasing the household income of the poor. The importance of basic literacy and numeracy is so obvious, and the evidence so overwhelming, that bilateral and multilateral agencies, philanthropies—even private businesses—are all investing in education. However, the development assistance to education in South Asia has never kept pace with the basic education needs. International organisations put emphasis on quality and equity in basic education and ""reluctantly"" shared strategies, without adequate evidence, to convince political and bureaucratic leadership to address chronic quality deficits in basic education in South Asia. In Bangladesh, a few development partners tried to include interventions to improve foundational literacy and numeracy in the fourth Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP), but their efforts were not concerted and sometimes subverted. The multilateral banks were more interested in disbursing funds than adding any accountability measures to achieve quality educational goals in primary education.         Read moreThe key changes needed in the education sector The second PEDP (2004-2010) received 37 percent as development assistance from 11 bilateral and multilateral donors for a total primary education budget of $1.8 billion. But through PEDP-3 and PEDP-4, this reduced as much as eight percent, despite the absolute value of donor contributions remaining constant, as the government substantially increased its primary education budget. The government funded this significant increase by negotiating more loans from multilateral banks, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank—loans which would have to be repaid. In effect, additional domestic government revenue mainly served political and bureaucratic goals—not learning goals for children and their parents, which continued to decline. Moreover, the declining donor share of the primary education budgets in Bangladesh reduced their influence in discussions about learning outcomes.         Read moreWe need a universal school education programme  Where now for basic education in Bangladesh? Where does that leave basic education in Bangladesh under the new political dispensation? Although education will not feature highly among Prof Muhammad Yunus's short-term priorities, there are opportunities to change and address the systemic failings highlighted above, not least through more consultative and inclusive processes. Undertaking an assessment of students' foundational skills using the ASER process developed in India is one such opportunity. The results will reveal the scale of the problem and determine how to take action quickly to reduce learning poverty levels.         Read moreThe education mission for the interim government Investing in teachers is a second essential strategy. Teachers' professionalism and performance are drivers of change in education. A reimagined teaching profession should attract and retain the best talents in the profession, but that also needs changed performance standards, status, incentives, remuneration, and career paths. This rethinking about teachers will be a longer-term task, but it should begin in earnest now. Decentralisation of education management under a single education ministry can open the process of reform to gain stronger traction and wider support. This will be important if a real impact is to be made on foundational literacy and numeracy. There is a real opportunity now in Bangladesh to stop the betrayal of politicians and bureaucrats. By meeting the demands of parents through focusing on learning outcomes and reforming the education system to accommodate many voices, change can be made possible.

sports,"Bangladesh's all-format captain Najmul Hossain Shanto expressed a wish to step down from captaincy after the ongoing South Africa Test series, the first match of which the Tigers lost by seven wickets in Mirpur last week and the final game to be played in Chattogram from tomorrow. Shanto is understood to be waiting for a discussion with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Faruque Ahmed before making up his mind regarding captaincy.. Bangladesh have produced positive results under Shanto -- the Tigers' maiden Test series sweep over hosts Pakistan in Rawalpindi in August-September being the highlight. However, pressure can be telling for someone who has to oversee a team in all formats. Even someone like Mominul Haque, who was captain only in Tests, was made to relinquish his role after a string of bad performances with the bat. Like Mominul, Shanto too is a key top-order batter. If Mominul's batting had become an issue, Shanto might as well feel that the toll of captaincy might hamper his batting in the long run. Thus, not only the team management but even on a personal level, Shanto would desperately want his willow to do the talking in the second Test against South Africa. In the last 12 months, Shanto has played nine Tests and averaged just above 25. His only ton during this period was also as the skipper -- during the home Test series against New Zealand in November-December last year when he had to stand in as a replacement for then Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan. However, in the six Tests prior to that New Zealand series, Shanto had averaged just over 48, a purple patch where he scored three of his five Test tons. But since he officially took over the captaincy role, his batting took a hit, drawing criticisms, even though his tactical nous as a leader has been praised. Shanto's last big contribution with the bat came last month in Chennai in the first Test against India in which he hit 82. Shanto's batting method and technique, however, looked similar during and before his captaincy. The question remains whether he is feeling the pinch of having too much on his plate now. The final Test against South Africa is a series decider with World Test Championship points up for grabs. Shanto and Co had a gruelling training session in Chattogram yesterday. Chattogram has offered good batting surfaces over the years and it could be what is needed to ease Shanto's predicament as a batter. For Shanto, having a positive outing with the bat in the final game against the Proteas might just help him get his form back and acquire the mental assuredness to make a call on his captaincy. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
sports,"When legendary footballer Kazi Salahuddin was elected as the president of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) some 16 year ago in 2008, hopes were that the former footballer-turn-organiser would revive the country's declining football and elevate it to a new height. But unlike his playing days, Salahuddin failed to deliver by and large as an administrator. By announcing he would not compete in the BFF elections, Salahuddin ended his 16-year tenure as the BFF boss, opening the door for Tabith Awal to get elected as the president in the polls held in Dhaka on Saturday. Tabith, a businessman, politician, and former footballer, won the elections by a landslide, receiving 123 of the 128 votes casted by the delegates and will be the BFF president for the next four years. After four consecutive reigns under Salahuddin, former footballers and members of the country's football fraternity are expecting something good from the newly elected committee, especially from new president Awal and senior vice-president Imrul Hasan, in the next four years. ""After Imrul was elected senior vice president unopposed, it was widely expected that Tabith was going to become president and it happened yesterday [Saturday]. I think this pair can be good for our football,"" former Bangladesh footballer Golam Sarwar Tipu told The Daily Star. The former national coach also explained the logic behind his thinking, ""Tabith himself was a player. He is a capable organiser as he runs a football club [NoFel Sporting Club]. Besides, he is passionate towards football, a well-behaved person and doesn't impose any decision on anyone. So, I want to keep my faith in him. Let's see what happens. ""Imrul is an experienced organiser who is running Bashundhara Kings brilliantly and built up a good sports structure there. So, the pair of Tabith and Imrul can do something different for football,"" Tipu added. Even though Salahuddin has stepped aside, seven members of the previous executive committee – Tipu Sultan, Mahi Uddin Selim, Jakir Hossain Chowdhury, Mahfuza Akter Kiran, Satyajit Das Rupu, Imteaz Hamid Sabuj and Bijon Barua – were elected in the new 14-member committee. Four fresh faces were elected as vice-presidents – Nasser Shahrear Zahedee, Wahid Uddin Chowdhury Happy, Sabbir Ahmed Arif and Fahad Mohammed Ahmed Karim. ""I thought the incumbent members would go through difficulty but they hardly faced any problem in getting into the committee again. Let's see what they do under new leadership,"" said Tipu, who is however not familiar with the four vice presidents who were elected for the first time. Former footballer Ashraf Uddin Ahmed Chunnu wants to reserve his judgement on the new committee for now, saying, ""It's too early to comment on the newly elected committee but I hope the country's football bounces back under new leadership."" The former national forward also emphasised on grassroot football which has been overlooked over the years. ""There is no alternative to going back to the grassroot football – setting up district, school and university competitions. The current committee should first make short, mid and long-term development plans,"" said Chunnu, adding that vice president Zahedee could be an important figure in developing the country's football. ""Zahedee has been running Shams Ul Huda Football Academy for a long time. He is dedicated to football and the committee should utilise him,"" said Chunnu. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
sports,"Success and controversy are apparently walking hand in hand for Bangladesh in their title defence of SAFF Women's Championship in Kathmandu. The charges of Peter Butler had started their campaign with a frustrating 1-1 draw against Pakistan, and have ever since created controversies off the field, all the while putting up stunning displays on the pitch, the latest of which was in the semifinals at the Dasharath Stadium yesterday in a 7-1 thrashing of Bhutan. Following the emphatic 3-1 win against five-time champions India, which ensured Bangladesh their passage to the last four as group winners, it was expected that the team would put an end to the controversies there and stay united till the end of the campaign. Yet, captain Sabina Khatun created more controversy with a Facebook post, apparently a dig at the coach, before coming up with an apology post pretty soon. Former coach Golam Rabbani Choton shared his opinion on media, riling up Butler even further, just ahead of the semifinals. There was uncertainty over whether Sabina would play a part in this match after having skipped Saturday's training, reportedly with a bout of fever. Well, she started and scored a brace, silencing the criticism and controversy surrounding the team. It was, however, Tohura Khatun, the wizard from Kalsindur who starred for the defending champions with a hattrick as Bangladesh ran riot against a team they had routed 8-0 at the same stage of the competition two years ago. The 21-year-old striker scored her first in the 15th minute of the match, after Rituporna Chakma had given Bangladesh a seventh-minute lead with a bullet of a shot, with a wonderful curling effort from the edge of the box following a bewildering pirouette to shrug off her marker. Sabina, the top-scorer of last edition, opened her account with a tap-in on 27 minutes before Tohura doubled her tally with a strike almost identical to her first eight minutes later. Sabina rounded off the Bhutanese keeper to grab her second of the game two minutes later before Bhutan pulled one back, thanks to some defensive miscommunication from Bangladesh on 41 minutes.   I have been in Bangladesh for eight-nine months and I have realised that it was always going to be trouble, so I just take it with a pinch of salt. I am far too professional to be irked by or be provoked by people who have not played at the level I have played at, who have not coached at the level I have coached at and don't have that level of professionalism and common decency. Bangladesh coach Peter Butler  While the coach took off a number of forwards and brought on some fresh legs in the second half, Tohura still had the legs to complete her hattrick with a placing shot in the 58th minute before defender Sheuli Azim completed the rout with a header in the 72nd minute. The Bangladesh coach praised the team's effort and the work he has done since taking charge eight months ago. ""It was nice to come here today and pull up a performance with a group of girls who have not disappointed. We have worked extremely hard for the last six-seven months to create that competitive nature and environment that you need if you want to progress,"" Butler told reporters at the post-match press conference while pointing finger at people who are trying, according to him, to destabilise the team.  I have been in Bangladesh for eight-nine months and I have realised that it was always going to be trouble, so I just take it with a pinch of salt.

bangladesh,"More political parties have agreed in principle with the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement's demand for the president's removal but emphasised that any action has to be based on political consensus. The development came after Anti-Discrimination Student Movement and the Jatiya Nagorik Committee yesterday held two separate meetings with Gono Odhikar Parishad and the 12-Party Alliance. The issues of annulling the last three national elections, removing President Mohammed Shahabuddin and rewriting the constitution were discussed at the meetings, Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the movement, told reporters after the meetings. While Gono Odhikar Parishad and the 12-Party Alliance agreed on the issues, they stressed on reaching a political consensus regarding the president's removal so that the culture of imposing a decision exploiting constitutional frameworks by the Awami League is not repeated, he said. The party leaders called for determining the process of removing the president through a political consensus and discussion among parties, Shakil Uzzaman, office secretary of Gono Odhikar Parishad, told The Daily Star. Earlier in the day, the 12-Party Alliance, formed with members of the now defunct BNP-led 20-Party alliance, gave a similar statement after the meeting with the movement leaders. ""Our aim is for the entire nation to come together and reach a final decision. The interim government must not fail in any way as such a failure would have dire consequences for the entire country,"" Mostafa Jamal Haider, head of the 12-party alliance and chairman of Jatiya Party (Kazi Zafar), told reporters emerging from the meeting. He went on to call for speeding up the reforms so that elections could be held at the earliest. He also called for unity among all parties, including the BNP. BNP leaders on occasions have said that removing the president would create a crisis the nation does not desire. The alliance leaders also enquired about the process of removing the president so that no constitutional crisis is created as a consequence. Following the meeting, Nasiruddin Patwary, convenor of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, called on the BNP to ""understand the pulse of the people"" and cooperate in removing ""the cobra sitting in the president's house"". Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir yesterday emphasised the importance of adhering to constitutional processes and avoiding hasty decisions regarding the removal of the president. ""We will not make any hasty declarations. We have a forum for discussion, and we will convene a standing committee meeting to clarify our stance following our discussions,"" he told reporters after laying wreaths at the grave of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
business,"A female garment worker succumbed to her injuries at Dhaka Medical College Hospital yesterday after being injured allegedly from police firing during a recent protest demanding arrears in Ashulia. Champa Khatun, 25, passed away around 7:30am while undergoing treatment at the hospital. Another female worker, Morsheda Begum, 35, who was injured during the same protest is undergoing treatment there. Confirming Champa's death, Inspector Md Faruk, in-charge of police outpost at DMCH, said she had sustained gunshot wounds to her abdomen, chest, and hands. The incident happened on Wednesday around 11:00am in front of the Generation Knit Fashion Company in the Narsinghpur area of Ashulia. Injured workers alleged that authorities of the factory suddenly announced the closure of operations about a month-and-a-half ago, leaving thousands of workers in distress. For the past three days, workers from the factory and several other factories had been protesting, demanding payment of their wages and benefits for the last three months. However, they claimed that no response was received from the management. On Wednesday morning, the workers resumed their protests. Workers alleged that at one point, police opened fire on the demonstrators, injuring three persons. Champa's brother Md Swapan said their family hails from Ahmedpur village in Pirganj upazila of Rangpur district. Champa worked as a sewing operator and lived in the Diakhali area of Ashulia with her husband Md Mithu and their daughter. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

Rizwana said these at a programme on the enforcement of the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act-2010 at the meeting room of the Ministry of Textiles at the Secretariat on Sunday. Responding to a question, she said BNP believes the removal of the current president could create a crisis though some believe it would not. ""The government's stance is to build a political consensus on this issue."" Rizwana also said there were no issue with taking the oath to this president, as the situation at the time required it, and there was no opportunity for alternative discussions.

bangladesh,"The workers of 18 tea gardens under National Tea Company Ltd (NTCL) in Sylhet have threatened to go on strike from Wednesday if their due wages are not cleared by Tuesday. The workers of NTCL including Lakkatura Tea Garden put up a barricade on Osmani Airport Road in Ambarkhana area of the city on Sunday morning demanding payment of their dues. They withdrew their blockade programme after two hours. They also said their work abstention programme will continue as before. Workers said they have not received wages for the past six weeks. They said they had been surviving on rations for the past two months. However, even the rations have not been provided for the past week, forcing them into extreme hardship, they added. NTCL General Manager Emdadul Haque said the company's managing board had been non-operational due to the recent student protests, which caused their bank to withhold loans. As a result, the company has been unable to pay the workers. He further said a new managing board has since been formed and expressed hope that the wages would be disbursed within the next week. So far, around 1.20 lakh kg of tea leaves have been collected from 12 tea gardens, with an average daily production of 18,000 to 20,000 kg of tea leaves. However, the strike has led to significant financial losses for the company, he added. The workers of Sylhet, Moulvibazar and Habiganj expressed solidarity with the movement. চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
bangladesh,"Saudi Ambassador to Bangladesh Essa Youssef Essa Al Duhailan on Sunday expressed eagerness to recruit more workers, especially skilled and trained workforce, to support its ambitious initiatives like ""Green Saudi Initiative"" and mega projects under the Kingdom Vision 2030. The ambassador recalled the invaluable contributions of Bangladeshi expatriate workers to the Saudi economy and society, praising them as diligent and hardworking. During a meeting with Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Saudi envoy said the Saudi Embassy in Dhaka is issuing a good number of visas every day, which is adding up to the already 3 million workforces employed in Saudi Arabia. Both the foreign secretary and the ambassador underscored the necessity of maintaining continuous engagement between their governments, including political consultations and the high-level Joint Economic Commission (JEC) as well as the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) on Manpower between the two countries.

sports,"Mohamed Salah rescued Liverpool as the Egypt star's late equaliser earned a pulsating 2-2 draw against title rivals Arsenal on Sunday. Arne Slot's side were on the brink of only their second defeat this season until Salah netted with nine minutes left at the Emirates Stadium. Liverpool had fallen behind to Bukayo Saka's early opener and, although Virgil van Dijk equalised, Mikel Merino put Arsenal back in front before half-time. Salah's eighth goal in 13 games in all competitions this season was aided by Arsenal's latest rash of injuries, with defenders Gabriel Magalhaes and Jurrien Timber both forced off in the second half. Manchester City were the real winners on Sunday as the draw in north London ensured they finished the weekend on top of the Premier League. Unbeaten City, who beat Southampton 1-0 on Saturday, are one point ahead of second-placed Liverpool, with third-placed Arsenal sitting five points adrift of top spot. It was only the second time Liverpool had failed to win since Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp in the close-season, starting his Anfield reign with 12 victories from 13 games in all competitions. Even so, Liverpool will be happier with the point after showing impressive resolve to twice come from behind against a fellow title contender. Arsenal were left to lick their wounds after the defensive injuries that left them fatally exposed. They were already without Riccardo Calafiori, sidelined by an injury suffered against Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek, while William Saliba served a suspension following his dismissal in last weekend's loss at Bournemouth. Mikel Arteta's side have now gone two league games without a win, leaving them with only three victories in their last seven top-flight matches in a major setback to their hopes of a first title since 2004. Saka's perfect start  Saka, back from two games out with injury, had given Arsenal the perfect start in the ninth minute. Ben White's sublime long pass sent Saka surging down the right flank before he deftly cut back into the Liverpool area, leaving Andrew Robertson trailing in his wake as he lashed a fierce close-range strike into the roof of the net. Merino nearly gifted Liverpool an immediate equaliser when he carelessly let the ball run to Salah, who rifled his shot just wide from the edge of the area. So often over the last two seasons, Arsenal have been dead ball masters thanks to their set-piece coach Nicolas Jover, but for once they were exposed as Liverpool drew level in the 18th minute. Luis Diaz beat Kai Havertz to flick on Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner and Van Dijk got in front of Thomas Partey as the Dutch defender stooped to head home from close-range. But Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces enabled them to regain the lead in the 43rd minute. Declan Rice's teasing free-kick arrowed into the Liverpool area and Merino was perfectly placed to thump his header past Caoimhin Kelleher from six yards. A lengthy VAR check followed to confirm Merino was just onside as the Spain midfielder celebrated his first goal since his close-season arrival from Real Sociedad. Arsenal keeper David Raya plunged to his right to keep out Alexis Mac Allister's header on the final seconds of a thrilling first half. Arteta's already makeshift defence suffered another blow when Gabriel limped off with a knee injury after a challenge from Darwin Nunez early in the second half. Without their first choice centre-back, Arsenal adopted a more cautious approach and Raya was booked for time-wasting with over 20 minutes to play. But the Gunners lost Timber to an injury in the closing stages as their defensive issues reached crisis point and handed Liverpool a lifeline. With just nine minutes left, Arsenal's under-manned rearguard was ruthlessly exposed as Alexander-Arnold's lofted pass sent Nunez clear of teenage substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly. Nunez slipped in the unmarked Salah and he slotted home as Arsenal slumped to the turf in frustration. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

asia,"Two senior leaders of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, said yesterday that infiltration from Bangladesh was on the rise and that coordinated efforts to stop it were needed to ensure regional peace and stability. Shah, on his first visit to West Bengal in six months, raised the issue of cross-border infiltration at two separate events, at one of which he accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government of being involved in ""state-sponsored infiltration"" and corruption. At both events, Shah urged the voters in West Bengal to bring about a change of guard by putting the BJP in power in the next assembly elections in 2026 to put an end to infiltration. ""Illegal migration harms India-Bangladesh peace. I want to say to the people of West Bengal, make a change (in state government) in 2026 and we will stop the infiltration. There can be peace in Bengal only if this infiltration stops..."" Meanwhile, in Guwahati, Biswa Sarma told a press conference that Indian states bordering Bangladesh must coordinate among themselves and with the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) to foil infiltration bids in the wake of the political turmoil in the neighbouring country. He said the Assam and Tripura governments are working together with the BSF already, but it will be a ""well-orchestrated effort"" only if West Bengal also starts identifying the infiltrators, as those sent back from these two northeastern states may re-enter through it. ""In the last two months, almost every day we have detained foreigners in our state. I feel that due to the porous boundary, in spite of BSF's best efforts, some people are being able to come into India illegally."" The Assam chief minister said 138 infiltrators were identified and sent back from Assam in the last two months by the state police in operations carried out independently and jointly with the BSF. ""We are least bothered about the religion of the infiltrators. If someone comes illegally, they must be pushed back."" চলতি বছর এখন পর্যন্ত ডেঙ্গুতে মারা গেছেন ২৮০ জন। "
world,"Israel bombarded Hezbollah and Hamas targets in Lebanon and Gaza yesterday, with no respite in the conflict one day after its strikes on Iran raised fears of a broader war. The Israeli military said it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters and struck 120 targets in southern Lebanon and carried out ""precision strikes"" on weapons factories and storage facilities in the Iran-backed group's southern Beirut stronghold over the past day. In Gaza, it said, it had eliminated ""40 terrorists over the past day"". Correspondents and witnesses in Gaza confirmed that the north of the Palestinian territory had been hit. Following Saturday's Israeli air strikes, which killed at least four soldiers, Iran said it had a ""duty"" to respond, but its military said it was prioritising a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also seemed to indicate that Israel was done striking Iran, saying the attack on Saturday was ""precise and powerful, achieving all of its objectives"". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to social media to say that the attack ""should neither be exaggerated or minimised"". In his post yesterday, Khamenei said Iran should make Israel ""understand the strength, will, and initiative of the Iranian nation and youth"". In Gaza, which UN human rights chief Volker Turk says is facing its ""darkest hour"", Israeli forces are again carrying out a ground and air campaign in the north that they say aims to prevent Hamas from regrouping. At least 42,924 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have since been killed in the Israeli offensive on Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable. The war has since drawn in Iran-backed groups across the region, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel has launched a major aerial campaign and ground incursions since late September. Smoke hung over the suburbs of Beirut after overnight strikes, which came after the Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings. The Lebanese news agency reporting bombing in the southern cities of Tyre and Nabatiyeh. The war has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. The Israeli military said four of its soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon, bringing to 36 the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since the start of ground operations on September 30. World powers had called Saturday for Iran and Israel to step back from the brink of all out war after a night of Israeli strikes targeting Iranian missile factories and military facilities. Iran has played down the significance of the strikes, insisting that only a few radar systems were damaged, and the United States has warned Tehran not to respond. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

Blake, who became one of the greatest poets in the English language, had worked as an apprentice to engraver James Basire, who made pictorial prints, one of the main ways to print illustrated books at the time. Blake's poem ""And did those feet in ancient time"", better known as ""Jerusalem"", is often considered England's unofficial national anthem, while ""The Tyger"" is a staple of English textbooks. One of the previously unknown doodles depicts an arrow, a frequent motif across Blake's works, while another depicts a miniature face. ""When I first saw the face, it was a staggering moment. I almost fell off my chair,"" said Blake expert Mark Crosby who found the engravings. ""I was looking back at something that had been made 250-odd years ago that hadn't been seen before."" Many of the engravings are invisible to the naked eye and were found using new, high-resolution scanning technology at the Bodleian Libraries at Oxford, to which the copper plates had been bequeathed in 1809. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

bangladesh,"The interim government does not have any plan to lift the ban on extremist groups that were outlawed in recent decades. The Chief Adviser's Press Wing Facts issued a notification clarifying the government's stance on the issue on its Facebook page yesterday. ""Extremist outfits, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Ansarullah Bangla Team are banned in Bangladesh. The Interim Government led by Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has a zero-tolerance policy towards all extremist groups in the country,"" the notification said. It said the government's attention had been drawn to a social media post by writer Taslima Nasreen, who ""falsely claimed early this week that the Interim Government had lifted the ban on the two groups"". ""Bangladesh does not have any plan to lift the ban on the two groups or other extremist groups, which were outlawed in recent decades,"" the notification added. On October 23, writer Taslima wrote on X, ""Mr Yunus is getting mad. He lifted the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami, and its student wing Shibir, but banned Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, the oldest political party in Bangladesh. He lifted the ban on Islamic terrorist organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ansarullah Bangla Team, etc."" Besides Hizb ut-Tahrir and Ansarullah Bangla Team, seven extremist outfits in Bangladesh are currently banned. They are Ansar Al Islam, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh, Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami Bangladesh, Allahr Dal, Shahadat E al-Hikma and Jama'atul Ansar Fil Hind al-Sharqiya. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
asia,"India has warned social media platforms of ""consequential action"" after hundreds of hoax bomb threats to Indian airlines this month triggered travel chaos and terror it said threatened national security. Some threats led to planes being diverted to Canada and Germany, and fighter jets scrambled to escort aircraft in the skies above Britain and Singapore. The government called the spread of the threats ""dangerously unrestrained"". It warned social media platforms of ""consequential action as provided under any law"" if they do not comply with the ""prompt removal of misinformation"". ""The instances of malicious acts, in the form of hoax bomb threats to such airlines, lead to a potential threat to the public order and security of the state,"" it said in a statement on Saturday. ""Such hoax bomb threats, while affecting a large number of citizens, also destabilises the economic security of the country."" At least 275 bomb threats were made since mid-October, all reported to have been false, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency. Other Indian media suggest it could be as high as nearly 400. ""The exemption from liability for any third party information... shall not apply if such intermediaries do not follow the due diligence obligations,"" it added. Civil aviation authorities have had to check every flight that has been threatened, many by messages posted on X, formerly Twitter. The government warning did not mention any social media company by name, but cited an advisory notice from the information technology ministry. ""The scale of (the) spread of such hoax bomb threats has been observed to be dangerously unrestrained due to the availability of the option of 'forwarding/re-sharing/re-posting/re-tweeting' on the social media platforms,"" the information ministry said. It said companies must report any offences ""likely to threaten the unity, integrity, sovereignty, security or economic security"" of the country, and cooperate swiftly with government agencies to aid investigations. The government on Monday said it is discussing ""legislative action"" to overhaul aviation and aircraft security laws, and to make those who make such threats guilty of a serious, or ""cognisable"", crime with longer potential sentences. India, the world's biggest democracy, regularly ranks among the top five countries globally for the number of requests made by a government to remove social media content. Last year, an Indian court hit X with a $61,000 fine after the platform unsuccessfully challenged orders to remove tweets and accounts critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
entertainment,"In the complex dynamics of Bangladesh's sociopolitical landscape, the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) stands as a cultural cornerstone, wielding the soft power of the arts against the hard edges of political polarisation and religious extremism. Established in 1974, shortly after the country's independence, BSA has evolved from a fledgling institution into a robust national academy of fine and performing arts. However, its journey, much like Bangladesh's own, has been marked by periods of turmoil and renaissance. The past two decades have seen a significant expansion of BSA's activities. In 2009, BSA's cultural initiatives received renewed focus. The academy's budget saw a tenfold increase over 15 years, reaching over Tk 100 crore annually by 2024. Despite corruption and lack of proper implementation, this financial incentive enabled BSA to extend its reach, establishing 486 Upazila Shilpakala Academies across the country—a move that democratised access to cultural resources. BSA's initiatives in theatre, music, and visual arts have proven to be effective tools for bridging divides in Bangladesh's politically charged environment. The academy's diverse programming speaks to a wide range of Bangladeshis, although often failing to transcend party affiliations and ideological differences. The nationwide theatre programme has been particularly impactful. In 2022 alone, the academy sponsored 120 plays across various districts, with a budget of Tk 84 lakh. While some productions, such as ""Jananir Swapnapuran"" and ""Janani Janmabhumishcha,"" focused on government achievements, many others tackled universal themes that resonated across political lines. Critical analysis suggests that while government-centric productions risk alienating opposition supporters, the broader theatre programme's ability to address shared social issues has been crucial in fostering dialogue. The power of storytelling through theatre allows BSA to humanise political opponents and foster empathy, countering the dehumanising rhetoric often employed in partisan politics. BSA's music programmes serve a unifying function by celebrating Bangladesh's rich musical heritage. The academy regularly organises festivals that showcase both folk and classical traditions. For instance, the annual Folk Festival attracts thousands of attendees from diverse backgrounds, creating a sense of collective pride that can override political differences. In the realm of visual arts, BSA's crowning achievement is the Asian Art Biennale. The 19th edition in 2022 featured 649 artworks by 493 artists from 114 countries, making it one of the largest art exhibitions in Asia. The biennale's themes are selected every year with an aim to encourage artists to explore complex social and political issues through their work. By providing a platform for critical expression, BSA contributes to a more nuanced understanding of national challenges. However, critics argue that the academy could do more to support emerging local artists and address contemporary social issues more directly in its exhibitions. As Bangladesh grapples with rising challenges to its secular fabric, BSA's role in promoting and preserving cultural heritage has taken on new significance. The academy's focus on folk traditions offers a powerful counternarrative to extremist ideologies that seek to impose a monolithic worldview. Previously, BSA has undertaken several initiatives to document and revive endangered folk art forms. For example, the academy's research wing has published over 57 research-oriented books between 2010 and 2014. While this research is valuable, more attention should be given to lesser-known folk traditions at risk of extinction. The academy's educational programmes play a crucial role in transmitting cultural knowledge to younger generations. BSA regularly conducts workshops and training sessions in traditional art forms. In 2021, despite the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic, BSA organised over 175 exhibitions and workshops across the country. These initiatives help create a sense of cultural continuity that can inoculate young people against the appeal of extremist ideologies. However, the effectiveness of these programmes in directly countering extremism remains to be empirically studied. While BSA's contributions are significant, the academy faces several challenges that limit its effectiveness. The close alignment of BSA's leadership with the ruling party has sometimes led to accusations of politicisation. The recent transition in leadership following the July mass uprising brought the longstanding issues to the forefront. Liaquat Ali Lucky, who served as director general for 13 years, stepped down on August 12 this year, amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement. A recent report revealed discrepancies in accounts of over Tk 227 crore between 2016 and 2021, raising concerns about resource utilisation and transparency. Following the resignation of Lucky, the appointment of Syed Jamil Ahmed as the new director general on September 9, marks a pivotal moment for BSA. Ahmed, a renowned scholar and founding chair of the Department of Theatre and Music at the University of Dhaka, brings a fresh perspective to the institution. In his first press briefing, he advocated for allocating three percent of the national GDP to the cultural sector and outlined plans for comprehensive reform. His vision emphasises transparency, with commitments to make expenditure breakdowns publicly available on BSA's website. Ahmed's appointment signals a significant shift in BSA's approach, with his declaration that the academy will reject any singular national, state, or ideological framework. His commitment to championing diversity across languages, ethnicities, religions, and schools of thought aims to create a more democratic and dialogical space for art. To enhance its impact, BSA must address several key challenges. The urban-rural divide in programme quality and frequency limits the academy's ability to counter extremism in vulnerable rural communities. While BSA conducts research, its impact on policy-making remains limited. The academy must balance preserving traditional art forms while encouraging innovation and addressing contemporary issues. Moving forward, BSA should focus on ensuring political neutrality through structural changes, improving financial transparency through regular external audits, and bridging the urban-rural divide through targeted programmes and digital initiatives. Strengthening research capabilities through partnerships with universities and think tanks, embracing digital technologies, and expanding international collaborations will be crucial for positioning Bangladesh as a cultural leader. Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy stands at a critical juncture in its history. As Bangladesh navigates the complex terrain of the post-August 5 political landscape, BSA's ability to adapt and respond to changing social dynamics will be crucial. Under new leadership, the academy has the opportunity to transform into a more dynamic and inclusive institution, one that not only preserves culture but actively shapes a national identity embracing both tradition and diversity. By embracing reform, enhancing transparency, and balancing tradition with innovation, BSA can strengthen its role as a cultural bulwark against polarisation and extremism. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"Rescuers in the Philippines searched a lake and scoured isolated villages yesterday to locate dozens of missing people as the death toll from Tropical Storm Trami hit 110. Trami rammed into the Philippines on October 24, forcing over half a million people to flee their homes, while at least 42 people remain missing in the storm's aftermath, according to the national disaster agency. The agency announced last night that at least 110 people were reported dead, though no provincial breakdown was provided for the death toll. Trami is the deadliest storm to hit the Southeast Asian country so far this year ""especially with the reported number of casualties"", Ariel Nepomuceno in the Office of Civil Defence -- which oversees disaster management -- told AFP. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos vowed yesterday that help was underway for the residents of Camarines Sur province, located in the hardest-hit region of Bicol. ""By air, land, or sea, we'll keep the support coming. Together, we will rise again,"" Marcos said on his social media accounts. Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon said they have recorded 41 deaths, most due to drowning, with emergency calls still coming in. ""We are still receiving many calls and we are trying to save as many people as we can,"" Dizon told AFP yesterday morning. He added that many residents across Camarines Sur province were still trapped on roofs and the upper floors of their homes. South of Manila, the death toll in Batangas province rose to 60, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao told AFP. Eight deaths were recorded in other provinces, bringing an AFP tally to 109, calculated from official police and disaster agency sources. But a ""higher death toll is possible in the coming days since rescuers can now reach previously isolated places"", Edgar Posadas, the Civil Defence Office's spokesperson said. In Taal Lake -- Philippines' third-largest and a tourist destination in Batangas province -- police, coast guards and a Marines diving team were searching for a family of seven yesterday. ""The waters from the mountains hit their home in Balete town, causing it to be swept away with them possibly inside,"" Malinao, the provincial police chief, said. Most of the deaths in Batangas have been attributed to rain-induced landslides. More than 20 bodies were pulled from heaps of mud, boulders and fallen trees, while police said at least a dozen people in the province were still missing. ""We will continue searching until all bodies are retrieved,"" Malinao said. About 575,000 people had been displaced by floods, which submerged hundreds of villages in swaths of northern Philippines, according to the national disaster agency. Moving westward, Trami made landfall in central Vietnam yesterday afternoon bringing heavy rain and winds of up to 74 kilometres per hour (46 miles per hour), the country's national disaster authority said. It knocked down trees and power lines in the coastal city of Da Nang, with state media reporting that three people were killed before and when the storm arrived in Quang Nam and Thua Thien Hue provinces. Before landfall, authorities had banned boats from going to sea, closed four airports and evacuated some 25,000 people in Danang, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces. A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"A Noakhali court yesterday sent two men to jail on charges of abetting the gang rape of a woman and her daughter on the night of October 21 in Companiganj, Noakhali. Police arrested Char Elahi residents Hasan, 36, and Harun, 32, on Saturday night after the mother filed a case under Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, said Inspector Abdus Sultan of Companiganj Police Station. The other accused in the case are Rashed, Saiful, Raju and Ibrahim. Police and locals said the woman, her daughter, and grandchild live in a secluded area. Her husband is a lorry driver in Chattogram and her daughter is a single mother. According to the complaint, the accused men broke into the victim's hut around 11:00pm and two of them dragged her outside and raped her beside a nearby pond and two others raped her daughter in the house as the arrestees stood guard. The men raped her daughter in turns until 3:00am, and before leaving, they took away the little money the women had in the house and other valuables, adds the complaint. The men also threatened to kill the women unless they kept mum about what had happened, it adds. Inspector Abdus told The Daily Star that police were looking for the other suspects. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"The Supreme Court has proposed establishing a separate secretariat for the judiciary to make it truly independent and effectively separate it from the executive branch. This will end the law ministry's control over the lower courts, SC officials said. The SC administration forwarded the proposal, along with a concept paper describing the necessity and objectives of a separate secretariat, to the law ministry. Separation of the judiciary has not been possible over the years because the political parties in power never really wanted it, reads the paper. A draft organogram of the secretariat was annexed to the proposal written by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed. If approved, the law ministry will take steps to set up the new secretariat and appoint a secretary, additional and deputy secretaries, and other officials, SC Special Officer Muajjem Hussain told The Daily Star. At present, the law ministry acts as the secretariat for the judiciary and therefore, it can interfere in recruitments, transfers and promotions of lower court judges, he said. If the separate secretariat is established, the power of recruitments, transfers and promotions of lower court judges will go to the SC, Muajjem added. Contacted, Law and Justice Division Secretary Sheikh Abu Taher said the proposal was conveyed to Law Adviser Asif Nazrul. The law adviser could not be reached for comments on the matter. On September 21, Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed in an address to lower court judges said he would take steps for the establishment of a separate secretariat for the judiciary. Supreme Court lawyers have long been demanding a separate secretariat for the judiciary. Before the proposal was sent to the law ministry yesterday, opinions of judges of both the Appellate and High Court divisions were solicited, officials said. Although Bangladesh is a constitutional democratic state, there are limitations in implementing the principle of separation of powers and ending the executive branch's tendency to interfere in the judiciary, reads the concept. ""The manifestation of a culture based on the rule of law and constitutional obligations has been severely affected since independence. Article 22 of our constitution declares the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch as a basic principle of the state,"" it says. ""In the era of globalisation, the application and practice of the principle of separation of powers… in the democratic state structure to curb the absolute powers of the executive or the government is well known."" In a modern state, if the three organs are not separated, the coherent practice of the constitution faces obstacles. ""As a result, the need to maintain a proper balance of powers between the various departments of the state is disturbed on the one hand, and the democratic foundation of the state as a whole is weakened on the other."" ""The highest court of Bangladesh in the judgement of the Civil Appeal Case No. 79/1999, better known as Masdar Hossain case, of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has cleared the way for the separation of the judiciary from the executive by making a complete outline. One of the basic foundations of the separation of powers outlined in the judgement is the establishment of a separate secretariat for the judiciary. In the judgement of Masdar Hossain case, the issue of institutionalisation of judicial separation has come up several times to ensure judiciary's independence. And the best effective way to separate the judiciary is to establish an independent judiciary secretariat. For this reason, in the judgement, the Supreme Court has considered the establishment of a separate secretariat for the judiciary by completely abolishing the joint jurisdiction of the law ministry and the Supreme Court in running the current dual rule that is the subordinate court judges' recruitment, transfer, discipline etc as an important adjunct of the separation of powers."" In the context of the unforgettable July-August mass uprising, now is the best time to ensure true independence of the judiciary by implementing the verdict of the Masdar Hossain case, says the concept. ""The first step in this effort is to establish a separate judiciary secretariat completely independent of the executive branch. It is possible to establish the rule of law through efficient, impartial and quality judicial work in our country only by establishing a separate judicial secretariat. ""In Article 109 of our Constitution, the power of supervision and control of all subordinate courts and tribunals has been delegated to the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. At present, Bangladesh Supreme Court Registry provides secretarial support to the Supreme Court and High Court Division in the management and control of various matters of subordinate courts. But this supervision and control of the High Court Division is not absolute, because in the existing structure, the High Court Division exercises its supervision and control powers after receiving various proposals related to subordinate courts from the ministry of law. But in terms of Article 109 of our constitution, the supervision and control of subordinate courts and tribunals is the exclusive prerogative of the High Court Division. Therefore, the establishment of a separate judicial secretariat is essential for the smooth implementation of this constitutional obligation. ""Besides, the scope of work of the Supreme Court registry has increased at a fast rate due to various reasons, including the increase in the number of cases, administrative activities of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, and the rise in the number of subordinate court judges. Considering this context, it has become necessary to set up a separate secretariat."" সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump headlined a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden yesterday, a high-profile event in a state that last backed a Republican president in 1984. Opponent Vice President Kamala Harris traversed Philadelphia, the largest city and a Democratic stronghold in must-win Pennsylvania. Speaking at the Church of Christian Compassion in the morning, Harris didn't mention Trump by name. ""In this moment we do face a real question: what kind of country do we want to live in?"" she said. Trump's rally in Manhattan, like Harris' event in Houston on Friday with Beyonce, hopes to lean on star power to support local congressional candidates ahead of the Nov. 5 election. U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who is supporting Trump's reelection bid with his X social media platform, enormous wealth and cash giveaways that have raised legal questions will be among the featured speakers, the Trump campaign announced. Trump, a New York celebrity for decades, will use the event at the iconic venue known for Knicks basketball games and Billy Joel concerts to deliver his closing argument against Harris. ""We want to close it out with a beautiful bang,"" he said last week. Polls show the rival candidates are neck and neck in the battleground states that will decide the next president with just over a week until Election Day. More than 38 million votes have already been cast. Trump has been seeking to tie Harris to the Biden administration's handling of immigration and the economy. Last week, Trump debuted a new attack line: ""She broke it, and I promise you I will fix it."" The U.S. economy has outperformed the rest of the developed world since the COVID crisis, and stock markets hit record highs this year. But high prices of food, utilities and housing have roiled voters, who believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction. Harris, who held a rally with Bruce Springsteen in Atlanta on Thursday, will hold another high-profile event with a speech on Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington, where she will highlight contrasts between herself and Trump. ""He is full of grievance. He is full of dark language that is about retribution and revenge,"" Harris said of Trump in response to questions from reporters on Sunday in Philadelphia. Trump, who held a rally in Long Island, New York, in September, has said he is making a play for the state. Ronald Reagan's reelection was the last time New York backed a Republican for president; Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by 23 percentage points. 'SHOW OF STRENGTH' By staging the attention-grabbing event in the world's biggest media market, Trump could help boost Republican candidates in New York congressional races. The state has seven competitive seats that could help determine whether the party holds onto the U.S. House of Representatives next year. It could also give Trump a boost in nearby northeastern Pennsylvania, a battleground state that has increasingly become home for New York commuters. Trump's campaign said the event at the 19,500-seat arena, which can cost upwards of $1 million to rent, was sold out. Tickets are free and on a first-come-first-served basis, as was the case with Harris' Houston rally. A crowd of some 30,000 people attended Harris' rally with superstar singer Beyonce on Friday night in Houston, and about 20,000 attended the Atlanta rally. ""My internal polling is my instinct,"" Harris said to reporters in Philadelphia when asked how the campaign is faring in its internal election projections. ""The momentum is with us,"" she said. After Sunday's neighborhood Philadelphia stops, Harris plans to visit every battleground state in coming days, including a Madison, Wisconsin, rally and concert with folk rock band Mumford & Sons and a Las Vegas event with Mexican pop band Mana. Trump's 2016 presidential opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, has accused him of ""re-enacting"" a pro-Nazi rally that was held at Madison Square Garden in 1939 on the eve of World War Two. Trump's critics have long accused him of empowering white supremacists through his dehumanizing and racist rhetoric. Her comments drew a rebuke from Trump and Republican leaders. ""She said it's just like the 1930s. No, it's not,"" Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Friday. ""This is called Make America Great Again, that's all this is."" Other speakers at Trump's Sunday event include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent presidential candidate who dropped out of the race and backed Trump; conservative commentator Tucker Carlson; and Howard Lutnick, who is chair and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and co-chair of the Trump White House transition team. Musk, the CEO of Tesla TSLA.O and SpaceX and owner of X, has traveled across Pennsylvania on Trump's behalf and has given $119 million to his pro-Trump spending group that is helping turn out voters in the most closely contested states. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"The number of mobile internet subscribers in Bangladesh dropped by nearly one crore to 12.69 crore in August, marking the second consecutive month of decline. Shahed Alam, chief corporate and regulatory officer at Robi, said customers have been discontinuing the use of secondary SIMs ever since a restriction on short-term data packages. He said the lack of smaller packages, like the three-day option, has led many Robi and Banglalink users -- who often use these as secondary SIMs -- to avoid subscribing to costly, high-volume packages. In October 2023, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) revised mobile internet package guidelines, discontinuing three-day and 15-day data packages in an effort to simplify offerings and enhance user experience. The minimum validity for data packages was extended to 7 days, addressing concerns that shorter durations were insufficient for many users. However, the removal of three-day packages led to user dissatisfaction as these plans were popular for their affordability and flexibility. On a year-on-year basis, the number of mobile internet subscribers increased by 5.99 percent 12.69 crore. Broadband internet subscribers remain unchanged at 1.35 crore. The BTRC provides broadband internet subscriber information on a quarterly basis. It calculates broadband subscriber information through market analysis, consultation and data collection from almost all internet service providers. Total internet subscribers, including both mobile and broadband users, now stands at 14.05 crore. According to Bangladesh Sample Vital Statistics, a project run by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the number of internet users increased by 1.8 percentage points to 41 percent for people aged above five. However, the report's findings indicate that a digital divide continues to exist in the country, underscoring disparities in internet access between rural and urban areas. Besides, the digital divide in terms of gender has worsened. The persistence of a digital divide between rural and urban areas also continued, with only 37.1 percent of the users residing in villages. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"Detectives arrested former housing and public works minister engineer Mosharraf Hossain in the capital's Bashundhara Residential Area yesterday in a case filed over the death of BNP activist Mokbul. Mosharraf, also presidium member of the Awami League, was sued over the death that took place on December 7, 2022, in Platan area. Dhaka Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Md Ziadur Rahman sent him to jail after police produced him before the court, seeking confinement in jail, said a court staffer. On September 30 this year, Mahfuzar Rahman, a BNP activist, filed the case against 256 people, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and 700 unnamed persons over the murder with Paltan Police Station. Mosharraf was elected lawmaker from the Chattogram-1 constituency several times. In the last general election, Mosharraf did not run and his son Mahboob Rahman Ruhel was elected MP from the constituency. In a statement, the family of Mosharraf, 82, said they were worried over his health. The former minister underwent hip surgery two years ago, which made it difficult for him to move without a wheelchair. Mosharraf, who needs daily physiotherapy, is also diabetic and a heart patient. The detectives went to his house and put him in the police van without a wheelchair, it added. Meanwhile, ex-DMP commissioner Khandker Golam Faruq was barred from boarding a flight to Thailand by the Immigration Police early yesterday. When he approached the immigration counter at the airport, he was questioned by an immigration officer and subsequently prevented from boarding the flight. ""He was not allowed to leave. We didn't detain him. When he arrived at immigration, we discovered he lacked the necessary clearance. We couldn't permit him to proceed,"" an immigration official of the Special Branch of police told The Daily Star. The former DMP commissioner is facing at least one case, filed with Dhaka's Kotwali Police Station, over attempted murder. He served as the 35th DMP commissioner from October 2022 to September 2023.  সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"Police have arrested two suspects in the murder of an activist of Jubo League, the youth body of the Awami League, in Rajshahi city. The deceased, 25-year-old Mohammad Mim from the Ramchandrapur area, was beaten and stabbed to death on Saturday night, according to a case filed by his mother Keya Begum at Boalia Police Station yesterday evening. Sabina Yeasmin, additional deputy commissioner (media) of Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, said Keya filed the case against 13 named and eight to 10 unnamed accused. Witnesses said a group of 10 to 15 youths aged between 20 and 30 first caught and beat up Mim in the Sagarpara area of the city around 7:30pm on Saturday. The assailants accused him of attacking a student-led procession in Rajshahi on August 5 during the mass uprising against the Awami League government.  The attackers forcibly took Mim to the Panchavati area by an autorickshaw around 7:50pm, the witnesses said. He was left in front of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital in a critical condition around 10:10pm.  Sankar K Biswas, in-charge of the hospital's emergency department, said Mim was brought dead at 10:15pm There were several marks of severe injury on the body, including extreme beating and stabbing, according to Sankar. Mehedi Masud, officer-in-charge of Boalia Police Station, said a team of the police station rushed to the spot on Saturday night upon getting information about the attack, but could not locate the place where Mim was taken. He said police arrested two named accused in the case and were trying to arrest the others. Mehedi also said that Mim was involved in Awami League politics. However, Mim's mother Keya said that his son was not involved in any kind of politics and used to work as a day labour. Locals said Mim was close to Jubo League leader Zahirul Haque Rubel, who was spotted attacking student protesters with two firearms in his hands during the uprising. Rubel was arrested and placed on remand several times after the fall of the Awami League government. Requesting anonymity, a neighbour of Mim said Mim used to reside in the personal chamber of Rajib Matin, a former finance secretary of Jubo League's Rajshahi city unit. Mim went into hiding after the fall of the Awami League regime. ""Mim returned to the area on Saturday and came under the attack in the evening,"" the neighbour said. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"The International Crimes Tribunal yesterday showed 10 former ministers and as many others arrested on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide during the July-August mass uprising. They were already behind bars in other cases. Talking to reporters after the proceedings, ICT Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam said the prosecution had filed three petitions with the tribunal, and it granted all of them. In the first petition, the prosecution sought to show arrested 14 people on genocide charges. The ICT had issued arrest warrants for them earlier. They are former ministers Anisul Huq, Abdur Razzaque, Lt Col (retd) Faruk Khan, Dipu Moni, Shahjahan Khan, Golam Dastagir Gazi, Kamal Ahmed Majumdar, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Rashed Khan Menon and Hasanul Haq Inu; former prime minister's advisers Salman F Rahman and Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury; former Supreme Court judge Justice AHM Shamsuddin Choudhury Manik; and former home secretary Jahangir Alam. The ICT ordered the law enforcers to produce them before the tribunal on November 18. In another petition, the prosecution sought to show six other people, who are behind bars in other cases, arrested on genocide charges. The six are former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, sacked army officer Maj Gen Ziaul Ahsan and police officers Abdullahil Kafi, Arafat Hossain, Abul Hasan and Mazaharul Islam. The authorities were ordered to produce them before the tribunal on November 20. Following the third petition, the tribunal issued arrest warrants for 17 former and current police personnel, including former Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Habibur Rahman, on similar charges of crimes against humanity. Chief Prosecutor Tajul did not reveal the names of the other accused, saying they might go in hiding if their names were disclosed.   Upon arrest, they will have to be produced before the tribunal on November 20. ICT Chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Majumdar and members Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Mohitul Haque Enam Chowdhury passed the orders after hearing the petitions. The reconstituted tribunal, on the first day of its proceedings on October 17, issued arrest warrants for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others for their alleged role in crimes against humanity and genocide during the student-led mass uprising. At least 863 people, as per the health ministry, were killed and thousands injured during the uprising. More than 60 complaints of crimes against humanity and genocide have been filed against Hasina, her party leaders and officials of her administration with the ICT investigation agency and the prosecution team so far. The Awami League government had formed the ICT in March 2010 originally to try the perpetrators of the crimes against humanity committed during the 1971 Liberation War. It later constituted ICT-2, and at least six Jamaat-e-Islami and BNP leaders were executed following the judgments of the two tribunals. The two tribunals were merged later. The interim government reconstituted it in mid-October after taking charge in August. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

business,"Bangladesh has been struggling to recover lost work orders in the home textile segment, a significant volume of which shifted to Pakistan nearly two years ago. This shift occurred mainly due to the sudden doubling of gas prices in Bangladesh and significant devaluation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar. More recently, labour unrest in industrial belts and months of political unrest in Bangladesh have contributed to lower receipts. Moreover, Pakistan possesses some inherent advantages. For example, it is the world's seventh-largest producer of cotton, according to Statista. Pakistan also enjoys benefits under the European Union's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), while Bangladesh only enjoys standard GSP facilities. When Bangladesh's government suddenly hiked gas prices by 150.41 percent in February 2023, from Tk 11.98 per unit to Tk 30 per unit, major home textile exporters refrained from booking work orders due to the abnormal surge in expenses in production and a good volume of work orders shifted to Pakistan. Khorshed Alam, chairman of Little Group, a textile miller, added that this move caused local home textile exporters to incur huge losses since work orders were based on lower prices before the hike in gas prices. For instance, if a big local company paid Tk 68 crore in monthly gas bill prior to the hike, it would cost Tk 126 crore after, he added. As a result, local millers did not book new work orders for some time. ""However, the export of home textile is gradually recovering,"" Alam said. Another major advantage of Pakistan is that it has readily available cotton while Bangladesh relies on imports to meet more than 98 percent of the demand for cotton in the country. Pakistan's performance in the home textiles segment is also noticeable in the country's export figures. Pakistan's textile exports surged to a 26-month high in August, reaching $1.64 billion -- a 13 percent year-on-year increase -- due to government policies and facilitation by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), according to a report by SAMAA TV, a private television channel. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, textile exports stood at $1.46 billion last August. Significant growth was recorded across various sectors, with knitwear and bedwear exports increasing by 15 percent, and ready-made garment exports up 28 percent compared to last year. ""Analysts attribute the rise to Pakistan's strategic positioning in the global textile market, especially in light of political instability in Bangladesh and international sanctions on China, which have led global importers to seek alternatives,"" the SAMAA TV report also said. On the other hand, Bangladesh's exports of home textiles, which include bedsheets, tents and rugs, declined 2.05 percent to $851.01 million in the fiscal year 2023-24, according to data from the state-owned Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). The country's home textile exports had crossed the $1-billion mark in FY21, registering a whopping 49.17 percent year-over-year growth. That momentum continued into the following year, with exports rising by another 40-odd percent to $1.62 billion. However, the gas crisis upended that trend the following year, with home textiles fetching $1.09 billion, down by almost a third. ""As per our previous plan, we were supposed to export $30 million worth of home textiles each month. But we are now exporting $25 million a month,"" said Md Shahidullah Chowdhury, executive director of Noman Group, which accounts for which accounts for more than 70 percent of Bangladesh's home textile exports. ""This is even less than the previous monthly amount, which was supposed to increase,"" he said. Of the exported amount, $15 million comes from home textiles and $10 million comes from the shipment of terry towels, Chowdhury said. ""We are trying to recover the lost business but some factors like low gas pressure and labour unrest are posing major barriers at present,"" Chowdhury said. Monsoor Ahmed, former chief executive officer of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, echoed Chowdhury's views. Ahmed said five to seven major home textile makers are currently exporting while a few big companies faced closures a few years ago for various reasons. Textile mills cannot run at full capacity due to low gas pressure and they cannot produce the goods adequately to be more competitive, he said. Furthermore, Pakistan has enjoyed zero-rated or preferential tariffs on nearly 66 percent of tariff lines, enhancing the country's ability to export to the EU market under the GSP+ since 2014. From 2014 to 2022, Pakistan's exports to the EU increased by 108 percent whereas imports from the EU increased by 65 percent. The total trade volume increased from 8.3 billion euros in 2013 to 14.85 billion euros. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is sending a team within the first week of December to review whether Bangladesh qualifies for the fourth tranche of a $4.7 billion loan programme. The IMF delegation, led by mission chief Chris Papadakis, will also suggest potential reforms required for securing an additional $3 billion loan, which was sought by the interim government to improve the country's forex reserve. Officials of the multilateral lender informed Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed about these decisions during a meeting at the IMF headquarters in Washington last week. A delegation from Bangladesh, led by Ahmed, is currently visiting the US to participate in the annual meetings of the IMF and The World Bank. ""Bangladesh is making good progress on the $4.7 billion loan programme. So, discussions are ongoing for the next review,"" said Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMF's regional office for Asia and the Pacific.   The IMF delegation will also suggest potential reforms required for securing an additional $3 billion loan He was addressing a press conference on October 24 on the economic outlook of Asia and the Pacific in Washington, DC.      ""We had discussions in Dhaka and discussions are ongoing in Washington on how to move forward in terms of financing. All those will be part of the upcoming discussions,"" he added. The IMF mission will review whether Bangladesh has met seven conditions for the fourth tranche of the $4.7 billion loan as of June this year. Bangladesh has fulfilled all of these conditions, except the one regarding tax collection targets. As per the IMF target, the government was supposed to collect Tk 394,530 crore in taxes by June.

Another major condition set by the IMF was to increase the country's net international reserves (NIR), which was fulfilled after the IMF lowered the required threshold in May upon request by the then government. The initial NIF collection target was $20.11 billion by June 30. However, the IMF lowered it to $14.79 billion later in May. As of June 30, Bangladesh had an NIR of $16.7 billion.

business,"The benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) sank to a near four-year low yesterday as large investors continued selling amid fears of further erosion of their investments. This prompted the stock regulator to form an inquiry committee yesterday. It will look into the recent downtrend of the DSEX, the prime index of the Dhaka bourse, and submit a report to the regulator within 10 working days.   Meanwhile, insiders and market experts said the intense political landscape and recent policy rate hike, along with lower-than-expected earnings disclosures of companies, played a catalytic role in the sharp decline. This dampened investment sentiment and discouraged investors from pouring fresh funds into shares amid price fluctuations. A huge forced sell also worsened the situation while buying appetite is low as investors cannot determine the bottom of the market fall. Investors currently do not have any confidence in the market, said Saiful Islam, president of the DSE Brokers Association of Bangladesh. As the second reason, he identified trigger sales or margin calls. ""The margin calls are not stopping. What we can do is restore investor confidence in the market,"" he said. ""To regain it, we need leadership."" ""Lenders can't go for the margin call. What we can do is restore the confidence of investors in the market, where leadership can play a vital role,"" he said. A margin call is a demand made by a broker for an investor to deposit additional funds into their margin account. If the investor fails to do so, brokerage firms or the merchant bank then go for the forced sale. The DSEX, the broad index of the country's primary bourse, plunged by 149.20 points, or 2.92 percent, to close at 4,965, the lowest in about four years. The last time the DSEX had reached such a level was on December 2, 2020, when it stood at 4,934 points. The other two indices of the DSE also showed negative performance. The DSES index for Shariah-compliant companies slumped by 36.28 points, or 3.17 percent, to 1,107 points and the DS30 index representing blue-chip firms dropped by 48.18 points, or 2.56 percent, to 1,830 points. The day's turnover stood at Tk 304 crore, a decrease of 0.72 percent compared to the previous day's trading session. The banking sector dominated the turnover chart, accounting for 20.56 percent of the total. Preferring anonymity, a top official of a stock brokerage said, ""The market is falling as investors find that anybody who cares about the market is not in the government."" ""So, buyers are rare in the market. On top of that, the fall is triggering forced sales for those who invested in stocks by taking margin loans."" The official said people who are now losing funds will not return to the market. Consequently, it would be more devastating for the market, he added. For the recent fall, he blamed large investors for selling shares. Islami Bank Bangladesh alone was liable for 17.76 points of the market decline. Renata, BAT Bangladesh and Square Pharmaceuticals compounded the woes with combined losses of more than 24 points. Grameenphone, United Commercial Bank, Olympic Industries, Beximco Pharmaceuticals, IFIC Bank and National Bank also suffered losses. At Chittagong Stock Exchange, the Caspi, the main index of the port city bourse, edged down by 295.99 points, or 2.07 percent, to settle at 14,006 points. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"The Minimum Wage Board, a government regulatory agency responsible for recommending changes to the minimum wage in different sectors, operates with limited data, which could lead to a lack of transparency and fairness in the wage-setting process, according to labour rights activists and experts. ""The board's data limitation complicates assessments of employers' ability to pay and broader productivity issues,"" said Mostafiz Ahmed, associate professor of social work at Jagannath University. ""The regulatory agency should establish a dedicated research wing to address the issue,"" Ahmed said at an event, titled ""Wage Determination of Minimum Wage Board: Scope, Challenges and Way Forward"", organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS) at The Daily Star Centre in Dhaka yesterday. In his keynote presentation, Ahmed said that the wage-setting process may not have transparency and fairness without clear calculations and economic justifications.   Experts pointed out that 20 of the 42 sectors have not seen regular wage increases for periods ranging from 6 to 40 years This, he said, could lead to dissatisfaction among both workers and employers. The Minimum Wage Board, the statutory body responsible for setting private sector wages under the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, receives and reviews feedback on recommended wage rates for 42 sectors, adjusting them as necessary.      According to different labour rights organisations, there are around 6.50 crore workers in these sectors. However, the highest employing sector in the country, agriculture, does not have a determined minimum wage. Wages in local farming are determined by the demand and supply of labour, while other sectors show substantial minimum wage gaps. Ahmed pointed out that 20 of the 42 sectors have not seen regular wage increases for periods ranging from 6 to 40 years. ""Two sectors have seen no revision in the past 35 years, while wage revisions in eight sectors have been overdue for 10-15 years, and in 10 sectors for 6-9 years."" He called for revising sectoral wages every five years. Ahmed also highlighted that the Minimum Wage Board's workplace inspections lack a standardised format. Without consistent guidelines, inspections may be less effective and the collected data might not provide a reliable foundation for decision-making, he added. He also recommended expanding the board's human resources to enable more effective operations. He proposed several reforms, including establishing a national minimum wage, democratising the selection of Minimum Wage Board representatives, setting criteria for independent members and improving sectoral representation and accountability. Ahmed also recommended regular wage reviews, fixed meeting schedules and publishing proceedings on the board's website to keep workers and stakeholders informed. He said that although the wage announcement is supposed to come within six months after the formation of the wage board, in this case it takes twice or thrice as long, or even more. In this case, the question remains as to what kind of policy determines the selection of board members, he added. Anwar Hossain, vice-chairman of the BILS, said that the attitude of depriving workers should be overcome, and their quality of life, economic empowerment, market conditions, price increases, and other factors should be taken into consideration. Nazma Akter, a union leader in the garment sector for more than 35 years and now the president of the Sammilito Garment Sramik Federation, said workers cannot be deprived of fair wages in the name of protecting the industry's existence. She said the government will have to come forward to fix a living wage, considering the participation of employers and workers in the country's economic development. Mamunur Rashid, chairman of the Minimum Wages Board, said the board has to work within its limitations. He said that workers cannot uphold their rights as strongly as owners and that owners should therefore be more worker-friendly.

business,"Consumers in Bangladesh saw no drop in soybean and palm oil prices over the past week even though the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has reduced the import VAT from 15 percent to 10 percent. On October 17, the NBR also exempted VAT at the production and trading stages of the commodity, which is mostly imported. It said the VAT benefit would remain effective until December 15 this year. The move came at a time when inflation has been hovering over 9 percent since March 2023. Food inflation has remained above 10 percent since April this year. Despite the VAT rate cut, prices of unpackaged palm oil, which is consumed the most, stood at Tk 148 to Tk 149 per litre yesterday, up 0.34 percent from a week ago. Meanwhile, prices of unpackaged soybean oil rose 2 percent to Tk 155 to Tk 160 per litre at retail in Dhaka city, according to data of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. The current prices are also higher from that a month and a year ago. ""The spiralling price of palm oil is driving the rates of other edible oils. Exporting countries are focusing on making biodiesel using palm oil,"" said a top official of a leading commodity importer and processor. The official urged the government to reduce VAT on the import of both palm and soybean oil to 5 percent to contain domestic prices. The World Bank, in its latest commodities price data, said palm oil prices soared 9 percent to $937 per tonne in the July-September quarter this year from $856 a year ago. A report by Malay Mail said a supply shortfall from Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer, was a factor behind the spike in prices in the international market. In September 2024, Indonesian exports dropped to 1.79 million tonnes from 2.38 million tonnes in August and 2.28 million tonnes a year earlier. This decline in exports has been linked to the impact of the 2023-2024 El Niño, which affected palm fruit yields, as highlighted by Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI). In the first eight months of 2024, Indonesia's production fell to 34.52 million tonnes from 36.29 million tonnes in the same period in 2023, it added. In a report on October 9, Reuters quoted a leading industry analyst as saying that implementation of higher biodiesel mandates in Indonesia is likely to tighten supplies of the vegetable oil. Indonesia currently has a mandatory 35 percent blend of palm oil-based fuel in biodiesel and is seeking to ramp up to biodiesel containing 40 percent palm oil to cut its energy imports. The plan, if implemented, could see a rise in biodiesel consumption to 16 million kilolitres next year. The move would involve the additional use of 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of palm oil, leading to lower export volumes, Oil World Senior Analyst David Mielke told a palm oil conference in Kuala Lumpur, according to Reuters. Abul Hashem, general secretary of Bangladesh Edible Oil Wholesalers Association, said there was no effect of the VAT reduction on the prices of edible oil in the domestic market. Prices of both palm and soybean oil rose by Tk 200 to Tk 250 per maund [37 kilogrammes] over the last one week, he added. ""Supply is short of demand,"" he said. The US Department of Agriculture forecasted that Bangladesh's consumption of vegetable oil would be 32 lakh tonnes in marketing year 2024-25, which began this month, up from 31 lakh tonnes in the previous year. Palm oil accounts for almost half of the nation's total domestic consumption while soybean oil is roughly one-third. The types of vegetable oil include coconut, olive, palm, palm kernel, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower seed oil. Bangladesh meets more than 80 percent of its vegetable oil requirement through imports. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"Ifad Autos has become the first local automobile company to export airconditioned (AC) buses assembled in Bangladesh. The company started shipping 11 of the buses to Bhutan this week and will send 11 more within this month. Ifad has achieved a historic milestone for the automobile industry of Bangladesh, said Iftekhar Ahmed Tipu, chairman of Ifad Group. Ifad has its own manufacturing plant, where the body of the AC buses were made. ""The bus export was really a matter of pride for Bangladesh, as the country has always imported this type of vehicles,"" he added. Apart from Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Myanmar and India's seven-sister states have also showed interest in buying AC and non-AC buses from Ifad, Tipu said. The chairman of the automobile company thinks his company will be able to export buses to many more countries if it is provided with government support. According to Tipu, a revolutionary change has been achieved in the field of heavy vehicles in Bangladesh over the past few years. Ifad Autos has set up a car manufacturing plant as the country spends a huge amount of foreign currency every year for car imports, he said. Ifad Autos, one of the companies of Ifad Group, has been marketing various models of AC, non-AC buses, trucks and covered vans of Indian automaker Ashok Leyland in Bangladesh since 1985. In early 2017, Ifad started assembling commercial vehicles in its Dhamrai plant in Dhaka with the technical support of Ashok Leyland. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
business,"Rows of robotic arms move with precision to assemble nickel-based battery cells on the production line at Indonesia's inaugural electric vehicle battery plant, the first in Southeast Asia. After being chosen by a joint venture of South Korea's Hyundai and LG for the $1.1 billion factory, Indonesia is now looking to boost investment to give it an edge in the race to become a regional EV hub. When he opened the West Java plant in July then-president Joko Widodo said such investments would make Southeast Asia's biggest economy an ""important global player"" in the EV supply chain. But while the country boasts the world's largest nickel reserves, analysts pointed out that it still faces a battle owing to its poor processing and refining capacity, environmental worries and the rise in other types of batteries. It also has some way to go to rival Thailand, which Krungsri bank said had market share of 78.7 percent of Southeast Asia's EV sales as of early 2023, with Indonesia following with eight percent. AFP was given rare access to the factory floor to get a glimpse of the plant's complex battery cell production, most of which will be shipped to Hyundai subsidiaries in South Korea and India. Hyundai said the new factory was a commitment to helping the archipelago become a supercharged Southeast Asian EV maker. ""It shows we are ready to support the government's desire to become a hub for Southeast Asia,"" Fransiscus Soerjopranoto, chief operating officer of Hyundai's Indonesian subsidiary, said. The government has unveiled a number of incentives to boost the EV market, including a luxury goods tax exemption that has boosted sales and seen a flurry of key brands entering Indonesia's 280 million-strong market, including China's BYD and Vietnam's VinFast. More than 23,000 battery-powered cars were sold to dealers between January and August this year, compared with 17,000 in all of 2023, Indonesian automotive association data showed. Under the regulations unveiled last year, EVs imported to Indonesia are free of duties until 2025 if companies commit to building production facilities and producing as many cars in the country as they import by the end of 2027. And Chinese automaker Wuling announced a plan last month to produce EV batteries at its Indonesia factory by the end of 2024, local media reported. ""We see a huge potential for EV purchase in Indonesia compared to other countries in Asia,"" said BYD Indonesia official Luther Panjaitan. Key to Jakarta's strategy has been luring automakers before they establish plants elsewhere, said Rachmat Kaimuddin, a government official who left in the transition to President Prabowo Subianto's administration last week. ""If they have already established factories in some countries, maybe they don't need to build in Indonesia,"" he said. Rachmat also pointed to Indonesia's nickel reserves as a difference-maker. ""It is possible to make a battery industry in Indonesia. That is what Thailand, Vietnam don't have,"" he said. However, the burgeoning industry faces challenges. While Indonesia aims to become one of the world's top three producers of EV batteries, investment in the sector remains relatively small. Realised nickel sector investment between 2020 and September 2024 was 514.8 trillion rupiah ($33.3 billion) and 19.14 trillion in the EV battery sector, investment ministry data showed. While Indonesia is number one for nickel reserves, it will be importing materials for the new factory including processed nickel from South Korea and China owing to its lack of related industries, said Hong Woo-pyoung, president director of the joint venture, PT HLI Green Power. And environmentalists warn nickel mining is one of the key drivers of Indonesian deforestation, while analysts added that the rise of cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, widely adopted in China, could hurt demand. Andry Satrio Nugroho, researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance, said the policies were ""not pro-nickel"" because all carmakers got the same incentives. But Rachmat said Indonesia has raw materials to make LFP batteries as well. A global oversupply of batteries could make it harder for Indonesia to attract more investment, said Putra Adhiguna, managing director of think tank Energy Shift Institute. Yet as boxes of packed battery cells towered behind him, Hong was unfazed about the future. ""This factory and ecosystem is very important for Indonesia's future,"" he said, adding that in the ""near future, the material will come from Indonesia to make a battery cell, to make EVs"". ""Indonesia is growing and growing every year about five percent,"" he said. ""The automotive market will be growing as well."" সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

In the period, the company's earnings per share (EPS) hit Tk 46.52, up from Tk 37.11 a year ago. The company credited the growth to higher revenue, an improved gross profit margin, and a boost in net finance income, as per its disclosure on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) website.

Its net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) for the six months ending in September 2024 was Tk 26.36, down sharply from Tk 95.37 a year earlier.

business,"RAK Ceramics (Bangladesh) Ltd posted a net loss of Tk 14.67 crore in the July-September quarter of 2024, according to an official disclosure, as the ceramics manufacturer attributed the loss to a gas shortage in its production lines and nationwide political turmoil. The company made a loss per share of Tk 0.35, significantly down from an earnings per share of Tk 0.29 in the same period last year, according to a disclosure on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) website. The ceramics manufa-cturer attributed the loss to a demand-supply gap caused by underutilised plant capacity due to inconsistent gas supply from the national grid. The company's share price responded sharply, plunging 8.52 percent to Tk 20.4 yesterday on the Dhaka bourse. Adding to the challenge, production and sales suffered due to unprecedented political disruptions during the third quarter, further impacting the company's performance, said RAK.   The ceramics manufacturer attributed the loss to a gas shortage in its production lines and nationwide political turmoil  Additionally, RAK Ceramics reported a loss per share of Tk 0.26 in the January-September period of 2024.      Its net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) also saw a downturn, standing at Tk 0.37 in the negative over the nine months as the company prioritised settling vendor liabilities on schedule, despite weakened sales and collection efforts. RAK Ceramics, one of the largest ceramics manufacturers in the world, is a publicly listed company on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange in the UAE and the group has an annual turnover of $1 billion, according to its website. The company is headquartered in the UAE and operates in over 150 countries with operational hubs in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia.

business,"Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) President Jin Liqun on Saturday criticized advanced economies for creating trade barriers including for renewable energy goods, saying there was ""no longer free trade"" in the global economy. The United States last month locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100 percent duty on electric vehicles, to strengthen protections for strategic domestic industries from China's state-driven excess production capacity. The European Union and Canada also have announced new import tariffs on Chinese EVs, the latter matching the 100 percent US duties. Jin, who heads the China-led development bank, said trade spats between advanced and emerging economies have increased partly because manufacturers in the latter have boosted their competitiveness. Emerging economies that build up capacity for trade and become competitive could be accused for over-capacity ""no matter how much benefit you can bring to your trade partners,"" he said. ""It's no longer free trade, because you cannot rely on the WTO rules,"" Jin told the Group of Thirty (G30) International Banking Seminar. ""What worries us even more is the barriers to trade in low carbon and renewable energy products, which are rising even more faster, just when we need more of these green products to save the planet,"" he said. AIIB was set up by President Xi Jinping in 2016 as a Chinese alternative to the World Bank and other Western-led multilateral lenders. US stocks ended mixed on Friday as investors awaited quarterly results from some of the world's most valuable companies next week. ""I'm dismayed to see this spat over trade. Free trade has brought huge benefits to so many countries since the end of second World War,"" he said. Jin also said the series of stimulus measures China's government has recently announced were different from those deployed during 2008-2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, in that they were now ""more focused."" China had more scope to expand fiscal stimulus, and so has been more proactive in expanding spending and issuing special bonds to help local governments and businesses, he said. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"An American researcher said an Israeli airstrike on Saturday hit a building that was part of Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program, and he and another researcher said facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles also were struck. The assessments based on commercial satellite imagery were reached separately by David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank. They told Reuters that Israel struck buildings in Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran. Reuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion. Eveleth said the Israeli strikes may have ""significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles."" The Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran's October 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used ""very light warheads"" to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran. In posts on X, Albright said commercial satellite imagery showed that Israel hit a building in Parchin called Taleghan 2 that was used for testing activities during the Amad Plan, Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and US intelligence say Iran shuttered the program in 2003. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons. Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, was given access to the program's files for a book after they were stolen from Tehran by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2018. On X, he said the archives revealed that Iran kept important test equipment in Taleghan 2. Iran may have removed key materials before the airstrike, he said, but ""even if no equipment remained inside"" the building would have provided ""intrinsic value"" for future nuclear weapons-related activities. Albright told Reuters that commercial satellite imagery of Parchin showed Israel damaged three buildings about 350 yards (320 m) from Taleghan 2, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed. He did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images. Eveleth said an image of Parchin from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse in the sprawling complex. Planet Labs imagery also showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in the Khojir complex where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed, he said. The buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures.  ""Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,"" Eveleth said. ""These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them,"" Eveleth added. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

world,"President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russia's defence ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its Nato allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. The 2-1/2-year-old Ukraine war has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the depths of the Cold War, and Russian officials say the war is now entering its most dangerous phase. Russia has been signalling to the United States and its allies for weeks that if they give permission to Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied missiles, then Moscow will consider it a major escalation. Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean ""the direct involvement of Nato countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine"" because Nato military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. Putin said that it was too early to say exactly how Russia would react to such a move but that Moscow would have to respond accordingly and different options were being examined. ""(The Russian defence ministry) is thinking about how to respond to the possible long-range strikes on Russian territory, it will offer a range of responses,"" Putin told Russian state TV's top Kremlin reporter, Pavel Zarubin. With Russia advancing at the fastest rate in eastern Ukraine since the first months of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with the West to allow Kyiv to fire deep into Russia with Western missiles. The US has not said publicly if it will allow Ukraine to strike Russia, but some US officials are deeply sceptical that doing so would make a significant difference in the war. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote, seen as a crucial test of democracy in the Caucasus country, would determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc. A group of international observers said the vote was ""marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension,"" while noting that election day was generally well organised. A mission from the EU parliament meanwhile expressed concern about ""democratic backsliding"", saying it had seen instances of ""ballot box stuffing"" and the ""physical assault"" of observers. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"Japan's ruling LDP party yesterday fell short of a majority in snap elections for the first time since 2009, national broadcaster NHK projected, in a blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. It was unclear whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party would be able to secure a majority in parliament together with its long-term coalition partner, the Komeito party. Ishiba, 67, took office on October 1 after being narrowly selected last month to lead the LDP, and called a snap election within days of taking office. The self-confessed defence ""geek"" and maker of model planes set as his target in the election the coalition winning a majority. Missing this objective would seriously undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
world,"China deployed fighter jets and drones as part of a ""joint combat readiness patrol"" around Taiwan yesterday, Taipei said, as Beijing slammed the latest round of US arms sales to the island. The US State Department on Friday approved a $2 billion arms sale package for Taiwan, including advanced surface-to-air missile systems and radar. The deal awaits approval by Congress. Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected 19 Chinese aircraft yesterday, including fighter jets and drones, flying near the island over a nearly four-hour period as part of Beijing's ""joint combat readiness patrol"" with warships. It was the third such patrol reported by Taiwan's defence ministry this month. ""Taiwan's military closely monitored the situation with joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, deploying aircraft, naval vessels and shore-based missile systems as an appropriate response,"" the ministry said. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said yesterday that the latest arms package showed that Washington ""time and again contradicts the promises of its leaders not to support 'Taiwan independence'... and damages peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait region"". ""'Taiwan independence' is as incompatible with peace across the strait as fire is with water,"" spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement. ""We urge the US... to stop arming Taiwan and stop sending the wrong signals to 'Taiwan independence' forces."" On Saturday, Beijing's foreign ministry condemned the arms package and said it had ""lodged solemn representations"" with the United States. A ministry spokesperson said Beijing would ""take all necessary measures to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity"". সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus yesterday said Bangladesh Navy and Air Force have once again been recognised as symbols of trust by the country's people. The two forces have stood by the people at this critical juncture, he said. He made the remarks while inaugurating the ""Bangladesh Navy and Air Force Selection Board-2024"" at the Air Force Headquarters in Dhaka. The Selection Board will evaluate officers for promotion, including captains, commanders, and lieutenant commanders from the Navy, and group captains, wing commanders, and squadron leaders from the Air Force. Yunus emphasised the need to select officers who exemplify honesty, leadership, and integrity in military service. The chief adviser called for the promotion of officers demonstrating professional skills, discipline, trustworthiness, and loyalty. He highlighted the role of principled leadership and directed the board to ensure promotions are awarded based on these merits. During his speech, Yunus paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War and the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement of July-August, acknowledging their sacrifices as fundamental to the nation's history. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"Local influential persons have encroached upon and filled up a government canal  in Lakhai upazila of Habiganj to construct different structures including shops and houses. This in turn prevents the canal from providing adequate drainage, thereby causing waterlogging on the adjacent lands in the area after rains. The local agriculture is also being adversely affected as croplands remain submerged. Visiting the area recently, this correspondent observed that numerous structures have been constructed encroaching on the canal between Bekiteka and Bamoi Tinpool areas along Habiganj-Lakhai regional highway. Some influential people have also been using the canal land for cultivation and fish farming. Locals alleged that Awami League leaders, led by Lakhai upazila AL president and former upazila parishad chairman Mushfiul Alam Azad, allegedly grabbed the canal land. They alleged that Azad, who is on the run after the fall of the AL government on August 5, held significant influence in the area, and had encroached on a large part of the canal, including filling up a portion to enable vehicles enter his house there. Contacted, Azad's younger brother Saiful Islam Sumon claimed that Azad had sold the property. Besides, Bulla union parishad chairman and local AL leader Khokon Chandra Gop, a close associate of Azad, allegedly built a market on the grabbed land, while some other local AL men set up mills. Contacted, Khokon claimed he set up market on his ancestral land. Another local AL leader built a market and bus stand on the western side of Bulla Bazar by grabbing the canal, while two local BNP men and their relatives have shops in Bamai Bazar area along the canal, alleged locals. ""There are several markets built grabbing the canal's land. There are also numerous houses, depots and other businesses. Also, all garbage produced in the locality is being discarded in the canal. All these led to the canal being filled up and causing waterlogging,"" said Salim Ahmed, a local trader. Azad Hossain Faruk, chairman of Bamoi UP, said, ""Since there is no political influence in the area at present, it is high time to take steps to save the canal."" Tofazzal Sohel, general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon's Habiganj unit, echoed him. Contacted, Nahida Sultana, upazila nirbahi officer of Lakhai, said measures will be taken to reclaim the government canal. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"The authorities opened Kalurghat Bridge to traffic from 10:00am yesterday after the completion of repair works. ""We have officially opened the bridge to traffic,"" said Zishan Dutta, bridge engineer of the Bangladesh Railways (BR) eastern zone. The BR kept the bridge -- a major crossing across the Karnaphuli river -- closed for traffic since the renovation work started in August last year, at the cost of Tk 43 crore. The Roads and Highways Department had launched a ferry service next to the bridge for vehicles to cross the river as people from the port city and Chattogram's three southern upazilas -- Boalkhali, Rangunia, and Patiya -- have no alternative to crossing the river without using the bridge. According to the RHD, around 22,000–25,000 commuters cross the bridge every working day. Constructed as a metre-gauge single-line rail bridge in 1931, the Kalurghat Bridge was later reconfigured in 1962 to allow vehicular movement too. However, BR has long been working to replace the Kalurghat Bridge. ECNEC recently approved a project for constructing a new Kalurghat Bridge. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"While the average global progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 stands at 19 percent, Bangladesh is not even aware of its progress so far due to misinformation, a lack of surveys, and dependence on government data, said speakers at an event yesterday.  They also said data on only 155 out of 231 indicators of the SDG goals were available, and such absence of data remains a major concern. The event, titled ""Citizen's Participation in the National VNRs Preparation Process', was organised by Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh at Aloki Convention Hall in the capital. Speakers said the country is set to submit its third Voluntary National Review (VNR) to the United Nations in June, but preparations are falling behind schedule. Bangladesh submitted its previous VNRs in 2017 and 2019. VNR is a process through which countries analyse their progress and challenges in implementing the SDG 2030. They urged the government to involve all sorts of non-state actors (NSAs) like different non-government organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations (CBOs), and civil society organisations (CSOs) in the process. Debapriya Bhattacharya, convener of the organising platform, said, ""The VNR should not be a government document only. Rather, it should be a national survey allowing the participation of all sorts of non-state organisations."" New opportunities have arisen following the mass uprising to fill the gaps and distortions of previous data and to evaluate the country's relations with different parties, said Debapriya, also a distinguished fellow of Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). Mentioning that the government-provided data doesn't reflect the real picture of the country, he said the government didn't allocate money to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for conducting surveys. ""They need to depend either on foreign funds or a new project,"" he added. In the keynote paper, Towfiqul Islam Khan, senior research fellow of CPD, said NGOs can help the interim government to undertake an objective assessment of the country's ""state of development"" and to highlight the achievements, challenges, and the next course of action. Priority needs to be given to the collective roles of non-state actors, he said. Bangladesh committed to submitting its third report incorporating five goals review -- health, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, life below water, and partnership for all the other goals, he said. Speaking as chief guest, Lamiya Morshed, principal coordinator (SDGs Affairs) of the Chief Adviser's Office, regretted that the country's institutions, data ecosystem, and statistical capacity have been significantly weakened in recent years and do not capture the ground realities. ""The interim government is committed to starting a fresh path to fixing and strengthening institutions and building statistical capacity and integrity. The focus will be on creating methods to collect data from more real-time innovative sources,"" she said. ""For reducing poverty and inequality, social protection measures and financial inclusion are important, alongside raising income levels and access to basic services,"" she added. CPD Executive Director Prof Mustafizur Rahman said the role of international partners should be evaluated in the upcoming event. ""They were supposed to assist Bangladesh to achieve its goals, but they didn't do it, neither in business, investment, nor finance,"" he said. Gwyn Lewis, UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, said, ""It's true that the globe is not making as much progress as they would like to be."" But it's time for Bangladesh to prioritise different aspects by using data from both the government and NGOs on marginal communities, indigenous communities, gender, environment, youths, and so on, she said. Executive Director of Campaign for Popular Education Rasheda K Choudhury, Adviser of BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health Ahmed Mushtaque Raza Chowdhury, Executive Director of Manusher Jonno Foundation Shaheen Anam, Global Vice President and Country Director of Hunger Project Badiul Alam Majumdar, and Executive Director of Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers' Association Salma Ali also spoke, among others. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
bangladesh,"With three days left in October, the total number of dengue deaths has reached 114, marking the highest monthly toll this year. This October also records the second-highest death count among all the Octobers since Bangladesh's first dengue outbreak in 2000, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The highest was 359 deaths in October 2023. This year, September saw 80 deaths, August 27, July 12, and June 8. Till yesterday, the total dengue death tolls this year stood at 277, with cases climbing to an all-time high. Experts predict that both deaths and cases will rise further, with dengue likely persisting year-round.   Lack of effective action by Dhaka city corporations in identifying and eliminating Aedes mosquito clusters, and insufficient surveillance in district towns are key factors behind the outbreak.— GM Saifur Rahman, entomologist Experts attribute this year's high fatality rate to inadequate mosquito control, delayed hospitalisation, the high prevalence of Den-2 virus strain, multiple infections, and diagnostic errors.      Entomologist Manzur A Chowdhury warned that cases may peak in November but will not drop significantly afterward, suggesting dengue infections could continue until February. GM Saifur Rahman, an entomologist from National University, criticised the lack of effective action by the Dhaka city corporations in identifying and eliminating Aedes mosquito clusters, pointing to insufficient surveillance in district towns as a key factor in the outbreak. He recommended that the government implement robust surveillance to identify hotspots, enabling coordinated intervention by local authorities, community groups, and schools. Dr Tahmina Shirin, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), advised that anyone with a fever should consult a doctor immediately and stay hydrated with fluids like coconut water, saline, and fruit juices. She also stressed keeping surroundings clean by removing stagnant water, which prevents mosquito breeding. Dr HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital highlighted that high-risk groups -- elderly individuals, pregnant women, infants, obese individuals, and those with comorbidities -- are more vulnerable to severe outcomes. He emphasised immediate hospitalisation for symptoms like severe stomach pain, breathing difficulties, extreme weakness, gum or nose bleeding, and vomiting, warning that failure to hospitalise at this stage could lead to shock syndrome. Dr Ahsan recommended consulting a doctor at the onset of fever and getting a Complete Blood Count (CBC) test on the third or fourth day, even if the initial NS1 dengue test is negative.  Lack of effective action by Dhaka city corporations in identifying and eliminating Aedes mosquito clusters, and insufficient surveillance in district towns are key factors behind the outbreak. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

While he used to stay open past 11:00pm earlier, for the past two months, he's been shutting down before 9:00pm, as muggers now begin to prowl the streets around 10:00pm. ""Living in constant fear has become the new normal, and it's affecting my business,"" he said. Monir Hossain, an auto-rickshaw driver, described witnessing at least three mugging incidents last week on Road 7 in Nabinagar Housing. ""It was around 8:00pm, and traffic was heavy because of rain,"" he recalled. ""Out of nowhere, three teenagers, probably 14 to 16 years old, emerged from an alley wielding large machetes. They approached an auto-rickshaw driver and his passengers, taking their cell phones, money, and other valuables before disappearing."" ""It happened right in front of me,"" Monir said, adding, ""But I could not summon the courage to intervene."" Being terrified, Monir, who used to drive through the night, now makes sure to head home by 10:00pm. It has become a common scenario in the Mohammadpur area over the last two months. According to DMP database, from October 1 to October 25, four murders, two robberies, and one snatching case were filed with Mohammadpur Police Station. In September, 17 murders and one snatching case were filed. According to sources, muggings and robberies are taking place in Mohammadpur almost every day, while the majority of them go unnoticed. Also, many victims do not want to go to the police, as they do not get any remedy even after complaining.   From October 1 to October 25, four murders, two robberies, and one snatching case were filed with Mohammadpur Police Station. In September, 17 murders and one snatching case were filed. During a visit to Mohammadpur yesterday, this correspondent spoke with around two dozen residents in different Mohammadpur areas, including Geneva Camp, Nurjahan Road, Babar Road, and Beribadh. Many said the situation remains unchanged due to limited law enforcement patrols after 10:00pm. Iftekhar Hasan, officer-in-charge of Mohammadpur Police Station, said, ""Since August 5, we have faced manpower and vehicle shortages, affecting our patrol duty. However, the situation is gradually improving, and we are hopeful for further progress as we are getting manpower and vehicles soon."" Alongside mugging, the number of theft incidents also increased, said Md Firoz, a stationery shopkeeper on Tajmahal Road. ""Drug addicts and local youths are behind them. They are taking away manhole covers, shop signboards, cell phones, and even clothes from balconies,"" he said. On Saturday, residents, including students, held a demonstration in front of Mohammadpur Police Station, demanding enhanced security. Following the protest, a joint operation was carried out in Mohammadpur, resulting in 45 arrests. According to an Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) press release, a coordinated operation involving the 46 Independent Brigade of the Army, Rab, and local police was launched around 10:00pm on Saturday. This led to the arrest of 45 suspects and the seizure of nine sharp weapons. ""The joint operation was planned to restore security for Mohammadpur residents,"" the release stated. The ISPR release said, ""Since the acquisition of magistracy power, 152 criminals, 18 firearms, 271 rounds of ammunition, 172 types of local and foreign weapons, one grenade, and a lot of drugs were recovered from Mohammadpur, Adabar, and Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police stations."" The ISPR statement emphasised that the army will maintain a firm stance to improve local safety. Regarding the arrests, OC Iftekhar said all the arrestees were shown arrested in previously filed cases. ""These arrestees, in groups of four to five, used to roam different areas of Mohamamdpur and mug people,"" he added.  From October 1 to October 25, four murders, two robberies, and one snatching case were filed with Mohammadpur Police Station.

bangladesh,"The court and the country's people will determine whether a ""terrorist"" organisation like the Awami League, which is responsible for mass killings, has the right to engage in political activities or if it should be banned, said BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed at an event yesterday. He made the remarks at a programme titled ""View Exchange with the Members of Martyrs' Families,"" held at Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center organised by Jamaat-e-Islami, Dhaka city north unit. ""We do not want any political party to be banned by administrative order or simply because of individual preferences. Let the court and the people of Bangladesh decide,"" he said. ""If the people make a decision, then they (Awami League) will have to see if they can accept the people's verdict,"" Salahuddin added. Referring to claims that the Awami League is a party with legacy, he said, ""Their 'legacy' includes establishing a one-party BAKSAL rule, engaging in violence, terrorism, anarchy, and vote rigging. On October 28, 2006, they committed brutal acts on the streets using 'Logi-Boitha'. A mass resistance must be organised against such actions.""   We do not want any political party to be banned by administrative order or simply because of individual preferences. Let the court and the people of Bangladesh decide. He further said, ""Attempts are being made to create a constitutional crisis. If there is a crisis, we must analyse the reasons behind it. In such crises, we must ensure that ousted accomplices do not receive any opportunities.""      Jamaat Ameer Shafiqur Rahman, speaking as the chief guest, said, ""The Awami League government did not dare to deliver justice. Instead, they sought to maintain power by killing people. We want justice through the legal system, not retribution. The oppression inflicted upon us should not be repeated against them, and they should receive justice fairly and impartially."" He also said Jamaat would provide legal support to the families of those killed in the anti-fascist movement. He said the ""martyrs of the July revolution"" are national heroes, whose sacrifices should be formally recognised by the state. He demanded the state to include their contributions in the national curriculum, from October 28, 2006, to the August 5 revolution. The organisation's Nayeb-e-Ameer, Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher demanded that those responsible for the ""genocide"" be brought back to the country to  ensure justice. He said it is not enough to hold only the individuals accountable; rather, the AL as a party and its affiliated organisations must be banned immediately. Members of families of martyrs also spoke at the beginning of the programme.  We do not want any political party to be banned by administrative order or simply because of individual preferences.

bangladesh,"This year, the over 200-year-old traditional Kundubari Fair in Kalkini upazila of Madaripur will be held for three days, instead of seven days. The district administration has opted to shorten the fair's duration following demands from a group of locals who cited concerns over various ""anti-social activities"" occurring during the event. The decision was taken yesterday. The fair is scheduled to commence on October 30 in Bhurghata village, coinciding with the Kali Puja festivities. The fair, named after the Kundu clan, is organised on the premises of Kundubari temple. ""We have given permission for a three-day fair following an application from the Kundu family,"" said Md Nazmul Islam, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of Madaripur. ""In previous years, outsiders used to arrange the fair by taking lease from local upazila administration. But this year, the Kundu family will arrange the fair,"" he said. ""As they do not have the experience to organise the fair, they have sought permission for a three-day fair. Subsequently, we have given the permission,"" he added. ""We will provide all necessary security for holding the fair and the puja peacefully,"" he added. On October 16, about a dozen locals submitted a written demand to the Kalkini upazila nirbahi officer, urging the cancellation of the fair. On October 22, the Kalkini upazila administration decided to stop the fair to prevent any potential violence or undesirable incidents, as confirmed by UNO Utthom Kumar Das. However, the UNO told The Daily Star that he was not aware about political affiliations of the people, who demanded to cancel the fair. The announcement of cancelling the fair sparked significant backlash on social media. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"

bangladesh,"The High Court yesterday issued a rule questioning the legality of Article 116 of the constitution that gives the powers of control and discipline of the lower court judges to the president. Article 116 says, ""The control (including the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave) and discipline of persons employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions shall vest in the President and shall be exercised by him in consultation with the Supreme Court."" In the rule, the HC asked the respondents to explain in four weeks why the provisions of Article 116 of the Constitution and the Bangladesh Judicial Service (Disciplinary) Rules, 2017 should not be declared contradictory to the constitution. The court also asked the respondents to show causes why they shall not be directed to establish a separate judicial secretariat at Supreme Court premises. The SC registrar general was ordered to submit a report on the progress of establishing a separate secretariat to the HC in 60 days. Secretary at the ministry of law and SC registrar general have been made respondents to the rule. The HC bench of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury came up with the rule and order following a petition filed by 10 SC lawyers in this regard. The law ministry on December 11, 2017 issued a gazette notification on the disciplinary rules of the lower court judges keeping the president's authority to control the judges. Article 116 of the original charter of 1972 had empowered the SC to decide on the posting, promotion and leave of lower court judges. The top court had also control over the magistrates' exercise of judicial powers and could discipline the judicial service staffers when necessary. সোমবার ফরেন সার্ভিস একাডেমিতে এক সংবাদ ব্রিফিংয়ে প্রধান উপদেষ্টার উপপ্রেস সচিব আজাদ মজুমদার এ কথা বলেন।"
