Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer's rivalry started in the sweltering heat of Miami and ended almost two decades later in tears and hand-holding in an emotional London farewell.
In between, the great friends met 40 times, battling out epics on European clay, London grass and hard courts from the United States to Australia.
Nadal edged their head-to-head count 24-16, coming out 9-3 on top in Grand Slam finals including his stunning Wimbledon triumph in 2008, widely regarded as one of the greatest finals at the majors.
However, the statistics only scratch the surface.
""When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving too,"" admitted a tearful Nadal as he played Laver Cup doubles alongside 41-year-old Federer in the Swiss star's final appearance in September 2022.
The two clasped hands as Federer hobbled into retirement.
""Very proud to be part of his career but even for me happier to finish our career as friends after everything we shared on court as rivals,"" said Nadal.
When Nadal equalled Federer's haul of 20 Grand Slam titles by lifting his 13th French Open in 2020, the Swiss described it as the ""greatest achievement in sport"".
Federer never begrudged Nadal moving past him to 22 majors.
""I can call up Rafa and talk about anything,"" said Federer at his emotional farewell in London.
""We enjoy each other's company. We have a million topics to cover. I always feel like any evening we ever spent together we never have enough time.""
Twenty years ago, it was another time, another place.
The only thing they had in common then was respect.
When they met for the first time in March 2004 at Miami, Nadal was just 17 and ranked at 34.
Federer was the world number one and had already captured the Australian Open and Indian Wells titles that year.
However, a fearless Nadal swept to a 6-3, 6-3 victory in 70 minutes.
""I was very worried about him beating me 6-1, 6-1 or 6-1, 6-2, but I really wanted to play this match against the world number one,"" said Nadal.
Nadal fretted if his friends back home could follow the match ""on Teletext"" while Federer correctly predicted more meetings to come.
""I was impressed with what I saw,"" said Federer.
- Wimbledon epic -The pair met at least once every year from 2004 until 2015 while Federer would go on to claim seven of their last eight clashes.Fittingly, they split their last meetings in 2019 -- Nadal breezing to a semi-final triumph at the French Open with Federer coming out on top in the last four at Wimbledon just weeks later.Epics were guaranteed.Federer avenged his 2004 Miami loss to Nadal 12 months later, winning the final in five sets from two sets down.Nadal had to dig deep to protect his 'king of clay' reputation in 2006, also needing five sets to defeat the Swiss in the Rome final.Federer struggled to chip away at Nadal's mastery of clay, winning just two of 17 meetings.At the Swiss star's second home of Wimbledon, he defeated Nadal in the 2006 and 2007 finals before the Spaniard claimed one of his greatest victories 12 months later.In almost total darkness after a final interrupted by rain, Nadal won his fifth Grand Slam title and first outside of the French Open.He missed two championship points in the fourth set but steadied to triumph 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-7 (8/10), 9-7 after four hours and 48 minutes.""For me, it was the most emotional match I ever played in, probably the best,"" said Nadal.They would meet again in three more Slam finals -- Nadal taking his first Australian Open title in a five-setter in 2009 and the 2011 French Open before Federer claimed the 2017 Australian Open in another marathon.Federer's win in Melbourne came after he had spent six months sidelined by injury the previous year.""Tennis is a tough sport,"" said Federer who was 35 at the time and had gone 10 years without a victory over Nadal at the Slams.""There are no draws. If there were, I would have been happy to accept one and share it with Rafa.""
The pair met at least once every year from 2004 until 2015 while Federer would go on to claim seven of their last eight clashes.
Fittingly, they split their last meetings in 2019 -- Nadal breezing to a semi-final triumph at the French Open with Federer coming out on top in the last four at Wimbledon just weeks later.
Epics were guaranteed.
Federer avenged his 2004 Miami loss to Nadal 12 months later, winning the final in five sets from two sets down.
Nadal had to dig deep to protect his 'king of clay' reputation in 2006, also needing five sets to defeat the Swiss in the Rome final.
Federer struggled to chip away at Nadal's mastery of clay, winning just two of 17 meetings.
At the Swiss star's second home of Wimbledon, he defeated Nadal in the 2006 and 2007 finals before the Spaniard claimed one of his greatest victories 12 months later.
In almost total darkness after a final interrupted by rain, Nadal won his fifth Grand Slam title and first outside of the French Open.
He missed two championship points in the fourth set but steadied to triumph 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-7 (8/10), 9-7 after four hours and 48 minutes.
""For me, it was the most emotional match I ever played in, probably the best,"" said Nadal.
They would meet again in three more Slam finals -- Nadal taking his first Australian Open title in a five-setter in 2009 and the 2011 French Open before Federer claimed the 2017 Australian Open in another marathon.
Federer's win in Melbourne came after he had spent six months sidelined by injury the previous year.
""Tennis is a tough sport,"" said Federer who was 35 at the time and had gone 10 years without a victory over Nadal at the Slams.
""There are no draws. If there were, I would have been happy to accept one and share it with Rafa.""

sports,Rafael Nadal calls time on epic tennis career,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Rafael Nadal on Thursday announced he will retire after the Davis Cup finals in November, ending a career which brought 22 Grand Slam titles, global respect and inspired epic, iconic rivalries with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.
""I am retiring from professional tennis. The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially,"" Nadal said in a video on social media.
""It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life everything has a beginning and an end.""
The 38-year-old Spaniard is set to end his two decades as a professional with 92 titles and prize money alone of $135 million.
He dominated the French Open where he won 14 of his majors, his first arriving just days after his 19th birthday in 2005, his last in 2022 making him the event's oldest champion.
On the famous crushed brick of Roland Garros, he lost just three times in 115 matches.
He was also a four-time champion at the US Open and a two-time winner at the Australian Open, his first triumph coming in 2009; his second 13 years later.
Nadal also won Wimbledon twice, in 2008 and 2010 despite grass considered to be the surface most likely to expose any shortcomings in his game.
His five-set victory over Roger Federer in the 2008 championship match, which ended in almost complete darkness at the All England Club, is widely regarded as the greatest Slam final ever played.
Nadal claimed a career Golden Slam when he took Olympic Games gold in 2008. For good measure, he also won five Davis Cups.
Nadal was a five-time year-end world number one and never left the top 10 from 2005 until March this year.
In total, he spent 209 weeks in top spot and between 2004 and 2022, won at least one title every year.
In his long rivalry with close friend Federer, who retired last year, he enjoyed a 24-16 edge. Nadal surpassed Federer's mark of 20 majors in Australia last year.
He and Djokovic, the all-time leader with 24 men's Grand Slam titles, met 60 times with the Serb just ahead by two.
An underpowered Nadal was swept aside by Djokovic in straight sets in their final meeting at this year's Paris Olympics.
Despite his record-breaking career, Nadal was plagued by injuries, a painful by-product of his all-action, brutal-hitting style.
- Injury-plagued-Ankle, wrist, knee, elbow and abdominal problems caused him to sit out 16 Grand Slam tournaments and withdraw mid-event on five occasions at the majors.At the 2022 French Open, he admitted that his title charge would have been impossible without daily pain-killing injections in his foot.Nadal then underwent a medical procedure which required nerves in the foot to be burned to allow him to extend his career.However, the creaks in the body were getting louder.An abdominal strain forced him out of Wimbledon where he had made the semi-finals.He was then struck down with a hip injury at the Australian Open in January as he crashed out in the second round -- his earliest exit at the majors in seven years.His wife Mery was in tears as she watched him struggle through to the end.Nadal possibly sensed the writing was on the wall in the Laver Cup in London two years ago when he played alongside Federer in the great Swiss star's final tournament.At 41, and unable to shake off a knee injury, Federer called it quits.The two men wept and even grasped each other's hands as the Federer era ended.""When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving too,"" said Nadal.

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment

In a bombshell press conference on Thursday, Bangladesh ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said that he had informed the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) that the upcoming South Africa Test series at home in October-November will be the last Test series of his career.
Following the fall of the Awami League government, of which he was an MP, Shakib has not returned to the country. He feels that if he can head back to the country and leave on his own terms, he will play the series against South Africa, which is to be his last Test series.

It is not just Test cricket that Shakib is set to leave as he further informed that he will not be playing T20 format for the next few series as he feels it is time to move on from the format.

Asked if he would play the T20I series against India, starting on October 6, he informed that he feels he has already played his last T20I.
""I think I have played my last match at the World Cup [against Afghanistan],"" he added.
When asked if the Champions Trophy in 2025 would be his last foray in the ODI format, he simply said ""I hope so. Nine more ODIs.""

sports,'Same errors' as toothless Tigers suffer series loss,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment

Bangladesh's batting against India once again fell uncomfortably short in the second T20I, this time in New Delhi, as the Tigers lost by a whopping 86-run margin -- their biggest against India -- in another cumbersome effort without wonder yesterday.
As a result, India take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series -- their 16th successive T20 series win at home since 2019.
At the Arun Jaitley Stadium, the Tigers did show early promise in their chase of a 222-run target. However, just like their bowlers stuttered after three early wickets, a few boundaries later their batting innings had a similar look to it like the series opener.
Parvez Hossain Emon welcomed Arshdeep Singh, starting the innings with a boundary. The entertaining over ended with two back-to-back fours, but the flourish was short-lived as Emon departed in Arshdeep's next over.
Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto arrived and hit two back-to-back fours in the same over, and then Liton Das hit a towering six off Nitish Kumar Reddy. From 38 for one in four overs, things went downhill from there.
Once Shanto departed, finding the fielder at long-on in the Powerplay, Liton got one from Varun Chakravarthy that stayed low, disturbing his stumps. Towhid Hridoy departed to part-timer spinner Abhishek Sharma, leaving Bangladesh's chase in shambles -- on 46 for four.
From that point onward, not much materialised. Mahmudullah Riyad, playing his final T20I series, got a few over the ropes. His 39-ball 41 seemed more like a vigil as the chase had already fallen off the tracks, eventually ending up on 135 for nine.
""I think we made the same errors [as in the first game], which is not a good thing as a team,"" Shanto said during the post-match ceremony.
""We need to improve. I think it was a good decision [to bowl]. They batted well after the first six-seven overs, but we didn't execute our plans. We need to take responsibility as batsmen,"" he added.
Earlier, Bangladesh pacers held their own in the Powerplay. Tanzim Sakib was impressive with his pace and variations, while Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman were also among the wickets as India stood at 45 for three.
Then Liton dropped what should have been a regulation catch off Sakib, giving Nitish Kumar a reprieve. Dropped on five, Nitish went on to pummel seven sixes during a 34-ball 74.
A 108-run stand developed between Rinku Singh and Nitish in just eight overs. Thus, even after a solid Powerplay effort, the game slipped away for the tourists.Taskin ended with two for 16 as the pick of the Tigers' bowlers. The margin of the defeat was also due to the batting-friendly track on offer. In last year's IPL, five games saw eight scores of 200 at this ground.
""Wanted to get a partnership with Nitish as the wicket was slow and was sticking in the pitch a bit. The no-ball from Mahmudullah shifted the momentum, and Nitish got going after that,"" Rinku said after the game, referring to a no-ball from Mahmudullah which resulted in a free-hit and India's first six.
But Nitish had made the difference after the dropped catch. Still, a disastrous batting performance is what the Tigers will take away from the game before they look to make amends in the series' final match in Hyderabad on Saturday.

Jayasuriya, 55, had been in interim charge since June, but on Monday was appointed full-time coach after recent successes, which included a Test match win in England and a home 2-0 Test series sweep against New Zealand.
Sri Lanka also won a one-day international series against India for the first time in 27 years under Jayasuriya.

Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on Wednesday urged his countrymen to stay by his side during his final Test, which is likely to be against South Africa later this month on home soil.
""As you know, I am going to play my last match very soon. From the beginning of my cricket career to becoming today's Shakib Al Hasan, you have driven my journey,"" the 37-year-old's post from his official Facebook page read.
""The entire story of my cricketing journey has been written by you! So, in my last match, the last chapter of this story, I want you by my side. I want to say goodbye [to cricket] along with all of you. During this farewell, I want to hold the hands of those people whose applause made me play well.
""In this farewell, I want to look into the eyes of those people whose eyes have been filled with joy at my good game and with tears during my bad matches.
""I hope -- not just hope, I believe -- that you will all be with me in this farewell. Everyone will draw the end of the story together as the hero of the story is not me, but you!"" his post read further.
Last month, before the second Test of the Tigers' ongoing India tour, Shakib announced in Kanpur his retirement plans from all three formats. He expressed his interest in playing at least the first Test against South Africa in Mirpur if not the entire two-match series.
The first Test will be held in Mirpur from October 21-25 while the second Test will take place in Chattogram from October 29-November 2.
However, Shakib's participation in the South Africa series depends on his selection in the squad and the security concerns that he brought up when he announced his retirement plans in India.
As a former lawmaker of the ousted Awami League government, Shakib's urge for a ""safe exit"" from the country after playing his final Test looked a bit far-fetched considering how reluctant the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials and some top government officials were regarding the issue initially.
However, to some extent, the situation has changed in Shakib's favour recently as he found strong support from Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Mahmud, who said that he wishes for the premier all-rounder to play his final Test match in Bangladesh.
Shakib, who was heavily criticised for staying quiet during the student-led movement that eventually toppled the Awami League government on August 5, apologised for his role in that period.
""I respect the sentiments of those of you who have been hurt or distressed by my absence during this critical time and I am sincerely sorry for that,"" Shakib's post said.

Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and opener Smriti Mandhana hit half-centuries as India defeated Sri Lanka by 82 runs to boost their chances of making the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup on Wednesday.
India piled up a tournament high of 172-3 from their 20 overs before Sri Lanka were dismissed for 90 off the penultimate ball of the match.
India now have two wins in three games ahead of their final group match with six-time champions Australia on Sunday.
Just the top two teams from each of the five-nation pools make the semi-finals.
Mandhana made 50 from 38 balls with four fours and a six to register her 27th T20 international fifty.
She also shared a 98-run opening stand with Shafali Verma (43) before Kaur put on a blistering display of shot-making.
The captain reached her 13th half-century in the format off 27 balls and finished undefeated on 52 with eight boundaries and a six.
Just as important for India, Kaur showed little effect of the neck injury she had suffered in the win over Pakistan at the weekend.
In reply, Asian champions Sri Lanka collapsed to 6-3 inside three overs before Kavisha Dilhari (21) and Anushka Sanjeewani (20) put on 37 for the fourth wicket.
But they always struggled to keep up the run rate with Ama Kanchana (19) the only other player to reach double figures.
For India, fast bowler Arundhati Reddy and leg-spinner Asha Sobhana returned identical figures of 3-19 in their four overs.
The result means that Sri Lanka have no chance of making the semi-finals after three defeats.

Former Bangladesh skipper Tamim Iqbal suddenly appeared in the press box yesterday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, just before the Tigers' second T20I against hosts India at the venue.
Tamim, who has been working as a commentator for Star Sports in the ongoing series, had a chat with the media before his commentary duties as he addressed some questions from the media on specific issues.
The first T20I of the series in Gwalior showed that there was a disparity in batting prowess between the two teams. Tigers' captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said wickets back home were a reason for the gap in skill even if it was not the only reason.
Tamim felt not much had been done about making changes when such complaints came from players.
""Who has taken any initiative? Whether it's the cricket board or management or players or whoever. So until and unless we don't take that initiative, maybe after two series you will hear the same thing. Maybe from me too. It's important to take the initiative,"" Tamim said.
There had been speculations about Tamim becoming a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director, but the cricketer clarified that he is not thinking about coming to the board at the moment.
""I'm doing commentary now, then I will focus on cricket. I'm not thinking about that right now (director),"" he told the reporters in Delhi.
Tamim was asked whether seniors sometimes fail to understand the gravity of retiring in the best way possible, downplaying their own legacy in the process. Mahmdullah Riyad announced on the eve of the second T20I against India that he would be retiring from the format at the end of the series, leading to questions about whether he could have ended his T20I career after the last T20I World Cup and not in an away bilateral series.
Earlier on this tour, Shakib also announced his retirement plans.
""Whenever anyone retires, it's not pleasant to hear or talk about that. Since I have spent so much time with them [Shakib Al Hasan and Riyad], of course, I feel bad. Also, I feel proud of both of them for whatever they have achieved in international cricket and whatever they have done for Bangladesh. You can criticise them the whole day but you cannot take away those things [their achievements],"" Tamim said.
Tamim himself has not retired from two formats -- Test and ODI. However, he has not donned the red and green jersey since opting out of the ODI World Cup in 2023. Asked how he will focus on cricket before the upcoming Bangladesh Premier League, he said: ""I will go from here and have two months which I will use to prepare for BPL.""

Joe Root went past Alastair Cook as England's highest Test run scorer with an unconquered hundred against Pakistan, anchoring his team to 492-3 in the first Test in Multan on Wednesday.
The 33-year-old overhauled Cook's aggregate of 12,472 runs and became the fifth-highest scorer of all time after he drove seamer Aamer Jamal for a straight boundary to reach 71 just before lunch.
Root was still batting on 176 at the close on day three with his partner Harry Brook on 141 not out, taking England within 64 runs of Pakistan's first innings total of 556.
The pair added 243 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket, rebuffing Pakistan's bowling attack on a lifeless pitch that had punished England's bowlers on the first two days.
Root's memorable 481-minute knock includes 12 boundaries. Brook amassed the same number and added a six despite suffering cramps.
Root reverse swept spinner Abrar Ahmed for a single to reach his 35th Test hundred -- the sixth most by any batsman -- getting to the mark off 167 balls.
Brook reached his sixth hundred with a single off part-timer Saud Shakeel from 118 balls, adding to his previous three in England's 3-0 series rout of Pakistan two years ago.
Root added 136 for the third wicket with Ben Duckett, who made a robust 84 and showed no effect from a thumb dislocation on Tuesday that forced him to bat at number four.
Duckett was the only man dismissed in the second session, trapped leg-before by Jamal after hitting 11 boundaries.
All three Pakistan fast bowlers -- Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Jamal -- have taken a wicket each. Frontline spinner Abrar has conceded 174 runs in 35 wicketless overs.
Pakistan also reviewed three not out decisions to no avail.
It was a day to remember for Root, who took 268 innings and 147 Tests to go past his former captain Cook's total of 12,472 runs from 161 Tests in a glorious career that ended in 2018.
Root also added 109 for the second wicket with Zak Crawley, who hit 13 fours in an 85-ball knock of 78.
Crawley failed to keep a flick down off Shaheen in the fourth over and was caught at the second attempt by Jamal at mid-wicket.
Duckett started with trademark aggression, taking five boundaries off Abrar and completing his 10th Test half-century off just 45 balls.
That helped Root accumulate steadily at the other end as he brought up his 65th Test fifty off 76 balls. He was applauded by a handful of England fans and teammates in the dressing room when he broke Cook's record.
The all-time list is headed by India's Sachin Tendulkar with 15,921 runs from 200 matches.
Cook said of Root during BBC radio commentary that he could ""see him overhauling Sachin Tendulkar's record"".
""I don't see that happening for Root to lose that hunger and ability to keep driving himself forward for the next couple of years,"" the former England opening batsman said.

South Africa produced a superb all-round performance to thrash Scotland by 80 runs in their Group B match at the Women's T20 World Cup in Dubai on Wednesday.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, South Africa chalked up a tournament high 166-5 in their 20 overs with captain Laura Wolvaardt (40), Tazmin Brits (43) and Marizanne Kapp (43) all feasting on some weak bowling and poor fielding.
Scotland, playing in their first World Cup, were never in the chase and slumped to 80 all out in 17.5 overs to be eliminated from the tournament after three successive defeats.
The win lifts South Africa, beaten by Australia in the final of the 2023 edition, to the top of Group B while Scotland, who had already lost to Bangladesh and West Indies, remain bottom.
Scotland made life hard for themselves, dropping a simple chance when Wolvaardt was on just two.
The skipper made them pay as she clubbed five fours and a six in her 27-ball 40 which took her past Lizelle Lee's 1,896 runs to become South Africa's top-scorer in T20I cricket.
She fell to a fine catch by Olivia Bell but Scotland again blotted their copybook with another bad drop which reprieved Anneke Bosch on three.
Brits hit five fours and a six in her 43 while Kapp smashed her 43 off just 23 balls, enough to give her the player of the match award.
""I was a little bit nervous at the start,"" she said.
""(We) knew the wicket was going to be slow. it played a lot slower than our first game. Luckily, it came off.""
The Scotland reply never got going, only Katherine Fraser (14) and Ailsa Lister (12) making it into double figures.
Nonkululeko Mlaba was the most succesful of the South African bowlers, picking up 3-12 in her four overs, while fellow left-arm spinner Chloe Tryon (2-22) became the first bowler to take two caught and bowleds in a women's T20I.

Bangladesh were on the receiving end of another hammering as they lost by 86 runs in the second T20I of the three-match series against India in Delhi on Wednesday.
The win meant that India took the series 2-0 after they beating the visitors by seven wickets in the series opener in Gwalior on Sunday.
Chasing a daunting 222, Bangladesh never looked like getting close to the steep total and were restricted to 1235 for nine in 20 overs.
Mahmudullah Riyad top scored with a 39-ball 41 and all seven of India's bowlers were amongst the wickets.

Nasser Shahrear Zahedee, chairman of Radiant Pharmaceuticals Ltd and founding president of Shamsul Huda Football Academy in Jashore, has been the focal point today on the first day of the nomination distribution for the upcoming Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) elections -- scheduled for October 26.
Zahedee, also a former member of Parliament elected independently from the Jhenaidha-2 constituency, has been running the football academy since 2011 and has produced many players for the senior and age-group national teams. Rimon Hossain, Mehdi Hasan Roy, and Mohammad Swadhin were among those who represented the senior national team.
Zahedee is also running a club named Rahul Smrity Sangsad in the Jashore Premier Football League.
""I got encouraged by the situation to see the name of Tabith Awal as a presidential candidate. I believe I can team up with him to take the country's football further if I am elected in the elections,"" Zahedee told The Daily Star today.
The first day of the nomination distribution saw a total of 25 nominations being sold, with incumbent BFF vice-president Imrul Hasan buying the nomination for senior vice-president. Four nomination papers were also sold, with Zahedee, former footballer Iqbal Hossain, Brothers official Sabbir Rahman Arif, and K-Sports CEO Fahad Karim buying the nominations on the first day.
Six incumbent BFF executive members -- Mahfuza Akter Kiran, Satyajit Das Rupu, Zakir Hossain Chowdhury, Amer Khan, Imteaz Hamid Sabuj, and Tipu Sultan -- were notable among the 20 nomination papers sold for executive members. Meanwhile, a total of 133 delegates cast their votes to elect a 21-member BFF executive committee.

Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment

Bangladesh head coach Peter Butler said he is unwilling to dwell on the past achievements of his charges, as his focus is on defending the title of the SAFF Women's Championship, scheduled for October 17 to 30 in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Holders Bangladesh -- set to leave for Nepal on October 15 -- will start their campaign by taking on Pakistan in a Group A fixture on October 20, before facing five-time champions India in their final group match on October 23.
The women in red and green have been in training since last December, under the guidance of Saiful Bari Titu, in a period which they played two friendly matches against Singapore.
Afterwards, the then BFF Elite Academy coach Butler was at the helm of the women's team, guiding them in two friendly matches against Bhutan in July.
""I don't look up on it as the defending champions because that's history. Anybody who dwells on the past, on past achievements, can end up getting a little bit short, and unfortunately, you end up lying on your backside in the dirt. I'm one of those, I look at the present, I love going forward,"" Butler told reporters after yesterday's training session at the Bashundhara Kings Arena in Dhaka.
The English coach added, ""What's gone is gone. It's a different group, a different mindset, but the focus is the same: we want to win the SAFF [Championship], and the most importantly, we keep ourselves in the present, and don't look back and dwell. I'm really pleased with this group.""

Defender Masura Parvin said that Butler has been training them to play attacking football instead of their usual defensive approach.
""We don't have two players -- [defender Akhi Khatun and forward Sirat Jahan Swapna] -- who played in the last SAFF Women's Championship, but the replacements for those two have been improving in the camp. We've been training well under the new coach,"" said Masura after training.
Winger Sanjida Khatun noted the absence of warm-up matches before the regional championship campaign.
""We could have identified our mistakes if we had had the opportunity to play preparation matches. However, we've been preparing ourselves and playing practice matches amongst ourselves. We will try to give our best in the championship,"" said Sanjida, adding that some of their players have experience playing in foreign leagues, which they hope to utilise in the SAFF Women's Championship.

Chelsea and Nottingham Forest have been charged by the Football Association on Tuesday after a pitchside fight broke out between their players during Sunday's 1-1 draw in the Premier League.
Forest's Neco Williams sparked the pitchside confrontation after his challenge on Chelsea's Marc Cucurella sent the full back sprawling into the technical area, upending his coach Enzo Maresca.
Several players then piled into a melee, including some off the bench, pushing and shoving each other before referee Chris Kavanagh regained control. The match had 11 yellow cards in total.
""It's alleged that both clubs failed to ensure their players didn't behave in an improper and/or provocative way around the 88th minute,"" the FA said in a statement announcing the charge.
Both clubs have until Thursday, Oct. 10 to provide their responses.

The country's top archer, Hakim Ahmed Rubel, left for the USA to settle down there for bread and butter, confirmed former archer Ashim Kumar on Wednesday.
""Rubel landed in New York on Tuesday morning, and as far as I know, Rubel came here to stay, as uncertainty loomed over his future as an archer in Bangladesh,"" US Green-card-holder Ashim told The Daily Star over the phone.
Rubel has spearheaded the national team in the recurve bow event since the suspension of Ruman Sana in late 2022.
Rubel has bagged several medals in international competitions. He was a gold-winning member of the recurve team event during the 2019 SA Games. He also won a silver and a bronze medal in team events at the Asian Championships in 2021. He was also a gold medalist in the 2023 Asian Grand Prix, in which he also bagged a silver medal in the 2022 edition.
Ashim also informed that Rubel initially communicated with him two to three months ago to express his intention to visit the USA, and that he finally contacted Ashim a week ago about his possible arrival in New York.
The former archer informed that Rubel would be starting his immigration process within a few days in a bid to get permission for a work permit in the USA.
Bangladesh Archery Federation general secretary Razib Uddin Ahmed Chapal told The Daily Star, ""Rubel left the camp for a week's leave, citing that his grandmother had passed away and that he needed some time to take his sick father for treatment.""
""Rubel could have left the country by informing us; we did not refrain from him, like what we did for Ashim Kumar. We may not fill the vacuum left by Rubel, but we won't get Rubel again,"" he added.

sports,Wimbledon calls time on line judges in favour of electronic system,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts
Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Wimbledon will break with tradition and replace line judges with electronic line calling from next year's championships, the All England Club confirmed on Wednesday.
The sight of immaculately-dressed line judges standing or crouching at the side and back of the grass courts has been a feature at the Grand Slam for 147 years.
Electronic line calling was first used as an experiment at the ATP Next Gen Finals in Milan in 2017 and was adopted more widely during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be used on all courts across ATP Tour events from 2025.
The Australian Open and U.S. Open have already replaced line judges with electronic calling although the French Open still relies on the human eye.
Wimbledon said the Hawk Eye Live Electronic Line Calling (Live ELC) will also be used across the qualifying tournament.
""Having reviewed the results of the testing undertaken at The Championships this year, we consider the technology to be sufficiently robust and the time is right to take this important step in seeking maximum accuracy in our officiating,"" AELTC chief executive Sally Bolton said in a statement.
""For the players, it will offer them the same conditions they have played under at a number of other events on tour.""
While popular with players, the decision will sadden traditionalists and likely mean the end of the arguments over line calls that are part of Wimbledon folklore, largely because of the antics of former champion John McEnroe who famously railed against the officials.
It will also spell the end of the Hawk Eye challenges in which players can ask for a video review of a close call -- also a popular feature with fans.
Chair umpires will be retained.
""We take our responsibility to balance tradition and innovation at Wimbledon very seriously,"" Bolton added. ""Line umpires have played a central role in our officiating at The Championships for many decades and we recognise their valuable contribution and thank them for their commitment and service.""
The electronic system, which reacts within one tenth of a second of the ball landing, is regarded as more accurate than human line judges who are often seen ducking for cover to avoid being struck by a 100mph serve.
A simple computer-generated call of 'out' or 'fault' will now be the final word on line calls.
In another change for the 138th Wimbledon, the women's and men's singles finals on the second Saturday and Sunday respectively will start at the later hour of 1600 local time, after the men's and women's doubles finals.
""The doubles players competing in the finals will have increased certainty over their schedule and fans will enjoy each day's play as it builds towards the crescendo of the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals with our champions being crowned in front of the largest possible worldwide audience,"" Bolton said.

sports,Sports bodies reeling from the changeover,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts
Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
While the July Uprising has ushered in a new era in Bangladesh, leading to promising reforms in different sectors, the immediate impact of the changeover on the sporting landscape has not been positive.
With high-ups of 45 national sports federations either in hiding or removed by the interim government, most federations are struggling to continue daily activities, let alone hold tournaments or send athletes abroad.
In order to carry out reforms, the Ministry of Youth and Sports formed a five-member Search Committee in late August and asked it to submit its recommendations to reform the country's sports within two months. However, the committee is yet to make any visible headway in reforms or provide guidelines to federations, which have been orphaned as a consequence of the post-Uprising turmoil.
Apart from Bangladesh Cricket Board, which had an amicablechangeupof key personnel, and Bangladesh Football Federation, which has largely been kept out of the government's interference, other sports federations have been dilapidated due to the change of power, and are left looking towards the Search Committee for decisions and guidelines.
Office bearers of some major federations have pointed out two factors creating roadblocks in carrying out their scheduled events: financial issues arising from the absence of signatories and a lack of decisions from authorised committees.
With general secretary Abdur Rokib Montu, a former assistant attorney general of the Awami League government and a central committee member of the Awami Jubo League, resigning from his post in the third week of August, and the removal of president Tofazzal Hossain Miah -- also a principal secretary of the Awami League government -- on September 10, the Bangladesh Athletics Federation (BAF) is struggling to perform daily activities due to a lack of funds and the absence of signatories.
""We had been running a national camp at BKSP since June but were forced to stop it on August 21 due to the shortage of money. We also postponed October's scheduled Summer Athletics meet,"" said executive committee member Farukul Islam, who previously served as the federation's general secretary for two terms.The BAF official also mentioned that a proposed junior camp has been postponed, and they are struggling to pay staff salaries due to the absence of bank signatories, adding that he suggested the Search Committee form an ad-hoc committee in athletics.
The activities of Bangladesh Swimming Federation (BSF) were halted briefly due to the absence of its general secretary MB Saif, also secretary of Gopalganj Jubo League, following the government change. The federation had stopped its BKSP national swimming camp for December's World Championships in Hungary for three weeks but resumed on October 1 after getting financial assurance from the executive committee on September 17.Vice-president Abdul Hamid said things have returned to normalcy, with the joint secretary now acting as general secretary, further informing that they are going to organise the national swimming championships from October 9 to 11.
Bangladesh Hockey Federation's (BHF) activities hit a snag after most of the top brass, including general secretary AKM Mominul Haque Sayeed, a former ward councillor of the Awami League, went into hiding after August 5.
The BHF was supposed to send 20 players to Europe to play in different leagues under technical adviser Gerhard Peter Rach, a move rescinded by the federation later due to the inclusion of a former Jubo League leader.
BHF's joint secretary Ariful Haque Prince, also a deputy sports secretary of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, said he renewed efforts to send the players to Europe, but that was stopped, adding that the representative of the federation president is currently looking after the federation's affairs.
However, players are training in BKSP ahead of November's Men's and Women's Youth Hockey Championships.
Bangladesh Shooting Sports Federation (BSSF) general secretary Intekhabul Hamid Apu, the younger brother of former state minister for energy Nasrul Hamid, left the country before August 5 and has not returned since. The discipline has failed to produce good athletes and results in international meets during Apu's 12-year reign.
With the president also removed, the federation is struggling to continue its camp due to lack of finances, informed Joint Secretary Mustaque Waise, adding that around 14 players have been training under local coaches.
Though the Bangladesh Chess Federation (BCF) president and former IGP Benzir Ahmed quietly left the country months before the government's ouster, the federation did not face much problem in continuing its activities. The BCF recently sent teams to the 45th Chess Olympiad in Hungary, while rating chess tournaments are being held regularly at home.
Former Dhaka North City Corporation mayor Atiqul Islam had helped make a buzz by organising international tournaments and sending the national team abroad since becoming president in 2015, but his absence and subsequent removal have completely stopped all volleyball-related activities.
The scheduled Asian Senior Men's Central Zone International Volleyball Championship has been postponed, while the national team's training camp has been stopped.
Long-serving general secretary Ashiqur Rahman Miku informed that they don't have a shortage of money, but there are some restrictions from the National Sports Council in using funds at the moment.
DMP Commissioner Habibur Rahman, a long-serving general secretary of the Bangladesh Kabaddi Federation (BKF), was removed on September 1, three days before BKF president and former IGP Abdullah Al Mamun was removed.
During Habibur's tenure, many domestic and international events were held, but now the federation's activities have stalled.
Joint secretary SM Nawaz Shohag informed that they have been struggling to withdraw money from banks due to the absence of signatures. On top of that, an army camp at the kabaddi stadium premises has stopped training from taking place.
The BKF official also informed that they have postponed the national kabaddi championship after the completion of upazila level, cancelled the proposed women's franchise league, while participation in the World Beach Kabaddi in Iran did not get the ministry's approval.
Bangladesh Archery Federation's general secretary Kazi Razibuddin Ahmed Chapal said that his office is being run as normal, despite the removal of the president, thanks to ""a system built over the years"". Chapal added that they have sent the youth archery team to the Junior Asian Cup in Chinese Taipei and will host the national youth championships from October 17 to 19.
While there are exceptions like archery and chess, which have been some of the few professionally managed sporting federations in the country, most sports bodies are still reeling from the uncertainty and hierarchical void left in the aftermath of the July Uprising. These federations hope that the sporting authorities in general, and the Search Committee in particular, get their hands on deck to restore vibrancy to the country's sporting landscape.

Briton Tyson Fury said he will throw caution to the wind when he faces heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk and aim for a knockout victory in their rematch.
In their first bout in May, Fury hit his stride in the fourth round and engaged in some showmanship as he caught Usyk with vicious body shots, but the Ukrainian battled back and turned the tide in the eighth round.
Usyk's powerful punches to the head left Fury reeling and the previously undefeated boxer struggled through the final rounds of the fight before losing by split decision and relinquishing his WBC heavyweight championship.
The rematch will take place on Dec. 21 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with the WBC, WBO and WBA titles on the line.
""I'm going to go in there with destroy mode. Last time I went to box him, I was being cautious. I boxed the head right off him,"" Fury told TNT Sports on Saturday.
""Let's talk facts. Anyone can get caught, as we've seen in a lot of these heavyweight fights, but this time I'm not going for a points decision.""
Fury added that he is still keen on facing fellow Briton Anthony Joshua, despite the former champion's knockout defeat at the hands of Daniel Dubois in an IBF title fight last month.
Joshua and Fury had been set to face off in a proposed 'Battle of Britain' bout in 2022, but the fight fell through.
""At the end of the day, it would be a travesty if we didn't fight,"" Fury said.
""No matter if he loses 20 more fights. If he doesn't win another fight and has 10 years away from the game, it doesn't matter, we have to fight.""

Aryna Sabalenka has set her sights on reclaiming the world number one spot and can close the gap on Iga Swiatek with a good run at the Wuhan Open, which is returning on Monday after a five-year absence.
Sabalenka is the top seed at Wuhan in the absence of Swiatek, who withdrew from the WTA 1000 tournament after announcing her split with her coach of three years, Tomasz Wiktorowski.
Sabalenka, who was upset in the quarter-finals in Beijing last week by Karolina Muchova to end a 15-match win streak, can become the first three-time winner at Wuhan.
But Sabalenka said Sunday in Wuhan that she cannot afford to put pressure on herself.
""Of course this is something I really want to do (become number one), it is one of my goals,"" said the Belarusian, who won the Australian and US Opens this year.
""But I learned in the past that if you focus on the rankings and defending points and all that kind of pressure, things can easily go wrong.
""So I prefer to focus on myself and when I'm on court I just try to bring my best tennis and fight for every point.
""If I'll be able to bring my best tennis I know that I can become world number one.""
The Wuhan Open is back on the WTA calendar for the first time since 2019, before the Covid pandemic.
The 56-player main draw begins on Monday featuring seven of the world's top 10.
Sabalenka clinched back-to-back Wuhan titles in 2018 and 2019.
She has a bye into the second round and will begin her quest for a hat-trick against Filipina wildcard Alexandra Eala or Czech top-40 player Katerina Siniakova.
""It's been a while since I've been here and I remember the first time winning Wuhan was a very special moment,"" said Sabalenka.
""Winning it two times in a row, that was very special. I was really sad that I couldn't come back the following year.
""And now coming back, everything feels like home and I have really beautiful memories from the past. I really hope I can replicate my result from 2019.""
Sabalenka, who claimed a third career Grand Slam title at the US Open last month, is just over 1,000 points behind Swiatek in the rankings.
The battle to be on the summit at the year-end is likely to go down to the wire at the season-ending WTA Finals in Riyadh next month.

International Masters Fahad Rahman and Monon Reza Neer missed out on opportunities to clinch Grandmaster norms in two different rating tournaments in Budapest, Hungary on Saturday.
Both chess players from Bangladesh finished top in their tournaments, earning 6.5 points each but falling short by 0.5 points of the required points to earn GM norms after drawing their respective boards in the ninth and final round matches.
Neer (2417 FIDE rating), who made a piece of history on the previous day by becoming the youngest Bangladeshi IM at 14 years of age, drew his last board against Hungarian FM Balazs Pasztor in the SixDays Budapest Two Years 2024 GM A tournament. He won the 10-player event with 6.5 points with four wins and five draws, but fell short of what would have been the first step towards becoming a Grandmaster.
Fahad, who has one GM norm to his name after having spurned a number of chances, wasted another opportunity on Saturday as he drew against Chinese FM Yining Chen in the SixDays Budapest Two Years 2024 GM C tournament.
The 21-year-old finished top of his event, earning 6.5 points with five draws and four wins.

Four-time Grand Slam winner Carlos Alcaraz made short work of China's Shang Juncheng on Saturday, defeating him in straight sets to breeze through to the Shanghai Masters third round.
Alcaraz broke in the first game and looked comfortable throughout his 6-2, 6-2 victory.
Teenager Shang became only the second Chinese player to win an ATP Tour singles title at the Chengdu Open last month, but he was unable to make much headway against the world number two.
Despite their enthusiasm for Shang, the crowd couldn't resist Alcaraz's charm.
At the Spaniard's encouragement, they broke into loud cheers when he won a particularly exciting rally in which he hit a tricky backwards shot to keep the point alive.
""I've been playing really good tennis lately so I want to just keep going and keep feeling it, keep feeling this good,"" Alcaraz said after the match.
""I just had one practice then was straight into this match, so to be able to show this level in the first match, I'm just really proud,"" he added.
The Spaniard came into the tournament on a nine-match winning streak, having just won the China Open in Beijing, defeating top-ranked Italian Jannik Sinner in the final.
Sinner is also in action on Saturday, facing Japan's Taro Daniel.

Joe Root broke Alastair Cook's England Test record of 12,472 runs on the third day of the opening Test against Pakistan in Multan on Wednesday.
The 33-year-old became England's highest run scorer in Tests, and the fifth highest of all time, when he drove Pakistan seamer Aamer Jamal for a straight boundary to reach the 71 he needed to surpass Cook.
As Root achieved the feat he was applauded by a handful of England fans at Multan stadium as well as his team-mates in the dressing room.
It took Root 268 innings and 147 Tests to pass the record of his former captain Cook, who achieved his tally in 161 Tests in a glorious career that ended in 2018.
Root, who made his Test debut in 2012, went to the lunch interval 72 not out with his record standing at 12,474 runs and counting.
The all-time list is headed by India's Sachin Tendulkar with 15,921 from 200 matches.

The 31-year-old was not included in the side for the ongoing first Test in Multan and with his wedding due Saturday is doubtful for the second match in the same venue three days later.
Stone said last month the date was finalised long before he was recalled to the Test team against Sri Lanka in August.
""It's a bit manic, but a nice problem to have,"" Stone told BBC Sport of his 6,500-kilometre dash to the altar.
Stone took seven wickets in the two Tests he played against Sri Lanka, with England winning the three-match series 2-1.
""We booked the wedding on the basis of me only playing for Notts at the time,"" he said. ""In the past I've always looked at future series and not done stuff.""
""Then you get injured, or not selected, and you think you should have just done what you wanted to do.""
England's Joe Root said he rearranged his own wedding three times because of tours with England.
""I'm really excited for him,"" Root said. ""It's a special time in anyone's life.
""I'm sure he is all over the place with everything that's going on, but it'll be very special for him -- and his wife -- starting a different chapter in his life.""

sports,Riyad calls time in T20Is as Tigers face India today,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Bangladesh will take on India in the second T20I in Delhi's Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium today in a must-win match which is set to be the penultimate outing in the format for veteran Mahmudullah Riyad, who announced he will be retiring from the format at the end of the three-match series.
As the team is trying to build towards the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup, there were questions whether the 38-year-old Mahmudullah would fit into the equation. The speculations gained momentum before the first T20I, when skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto hinted that Mahmudullah would have a discussion about his future with the selectors after the series.
Mahmudullah put an end to all the rumours yesterday in the pre-match press conference, saying that his decision to retire from the format after the India series was 'predetermined'.
Thus Bangladesh's 'finisher' called time on his T20I career, announcing that the third T20I to be played in Hyderabad would be his last.
Asked to remember his high and low points in T20Is, the answer must have been pretty easy for Mahmudullah, as his role is such that it usually converges with Bangladesh's high and low points.
""The most frustrating moment was in Bangalore 2016 against India,"" Mahmudullah said referring to the T20 World Cup match against India where he and Mushfiqur Rahim failed to score two off three balls.
""And greatest moment was probably in Nidahas Trophy, the match that we won against Sri Lanka,"" he recalled the match where he hit an unbeaten 43 off 18 balls to seal a thrilling victory.
The end of Mahmudullah's 17-year journey in T20Is is in sight, but the Tigers' post-Mahmudullah era has not begun quite yet. The veteran batter will be there in the second T20I in Delhi in the same venue where he and Mushfiqur stayed till the end to ensure Bangladesh's maiden T20I victory – a seven-wicket win – over India back in 2019.
Bangladesh also hold fond memories of beating Sri Lanka here in the 2023 ODI World Cup, the last international fixture to be played at the venue.
Following a poor batting performance in the first T20I, which they lost by seven wickets, the Tigers' batting unit will have to find answers if Bangladesh are to make it three in three at the venue.
Batting lower down the order, Mahmudullah has been the difference maker in many of Bangladesh's memorable wins. With the Tigers trailing the series 1-0, another such heroic performance in the second T20I, which will begin at 7:30 PM Bangladesh time, might prove to be exactly what they need to keep the series alive.

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Since the beginning of Bangladesh's three-match T20I series against hosts India, there have been speculations regarding Mahmudullah Riyad's retirement from the shortest format. Even Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) sources had revealed early on Tuesday that there was an announcement coming from Mahmudullah.
So, when the 38-year-old appeared for the pre-match press conference ahead of the Tigers' second T20I in Delhi yesterday, there was a certainty regarding the matter. But he still needed to clarify.
""Can you clear the air about the speculations going around regarding your T20I retirement?"" he was asked.
Mahmudullah, for the most part of his career, had to adjust and adapt to situations that were not favourable or ideal. He had to do the same thing yesterday as well. With a wry smile on his face, Mahmudullah had to wait to answer the query as the mic was not working.
When the mic situation was finally fixed after a few minutes, he finally declared: ""I'm retiring from the T20I cricket after the last game of this series.
""Actually, I was pretty decided before coming here [in India]. I talked with my family, captain, and coach. I also talked with the selector and the board president, mentioning that I'm retiring from this format. I think it's the right time to move on from this format and try to focus on the ODIs that's coming ahead.""
Mahmudullah's retirement would bring the curtain down on not only his 17 years of experience at the top level but also on the era of Bangladesh's 'big five' in T20Is.
Mashrafe Bin Mortaza retired in 2017 while Mushfiqur Rahim and Tamim Iqbal stepped away in 2022.
After Shakib Al Hasan announced his retirement plans in Kanpur during this series -- stating that he had already played his final T20I -- Mahmudullah was the last one remaining from the Tigers' 'big five' in the format.
Mahmudullah was asked whether senior stars could not plan retirement properly, especially since T20 World Cups could serve as a better platform for such announcements from senior stars.
""I don't think that way. It depends on the individual. If I think I will retire from Bangladesh, probably it will be too late. Probably it won't be a good idea. I think this is the right time to take the decision and I think I took the right decision,"" he said.
Asked whether it was a disappointment for the 'big five' of Bangladesh cricket to end without a major trophy, Mahmudullah admitted that it was disappointing but mentioned that this is not how he would gauge achievements on the field.
""Yes, it is a bit sad but I won't accept that we don't have any achievement. If winning trophies is the benchmark, then a lot of legendary cricketers may not be called legends. So that's my thought.""
Mahmudullah also reflected on the challenges he had to face while playing the role of a finisher -- a task that was made even harder in a team with consistent top-order failures.
""If I think about the finisher role, batting at number six or seven is probably the hardest job in T20I cricket as there remains a chance of failing in three of the five innings that you get to bat.
""Maybe you will help the team win in one innings while in another, you may do averagely. You have to be backed by the team and the team management no matter what the outside noise and no matter what the media says. More importantly, the team need to assure you,"" Mahmudullah said, hinting that perhaps he has not always received that support.
Just like his role as a finisher, there were hit and miss moments throughout his career -- like the time he helped Bangladesh win the game against Sri Lanka in the Nidahas Trophy in 2018 with an outrageous six, or, the time he disappointed with a questionable safe approach in the Super Eight game against Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup this year.
However, for Mahmudullah, there remain ""no regrets"".

Australia continued their march towards a seventh Women's T20 World Cup title with a crushing 60-run win over New Zealand in their Group A match in Sharjah on Tuesday.
After posting a tournament high 148-8 in their 20 overs with Beth Mooney top-scoring with 40, Australia stifled the New Zealand batters who folded for just 88 in 19.2 overs.
Quick bowler Megan Schutt was the pick of the Australian bowlers, her return of 3-3 in 3.2 overs netting her the Player of the Match award.
""We could have been smarter with the bat at the end, but we came out really well with the ball and I'm really happy with that,"" said Australia skipper Alyssa Healy.
""Megan Schutt has been wonderful but I thought the whole attack tonight was unbelievable.""
Holders Australia, who have won six of the eight previous tournaments, top Group A while New Zealand slip to third, behind Pakistan but still above India on net run rate.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Healy gave her side the perfect start, smearing four fours in a rapid 20-ball 26 before skying a slower ball from Rosemary Mair into the covers.
Ellyse Perry was dropped on four at long-on by Maddy Green and went on to add 45 with Mooney who finally fell to Amelia Kerr for 40, with Green this time clinging on at mid-off.
As Australia wobbled in the middle order, Amelia Kerr used her googly to bowl Perry (30) and Grace Harris (0) with successive balls.
Kerr then made a good catch to pick up Phoebe Litchfield (18) for the second time in the deep.
Australia lost a flurry of wickets but still posted a daunting target for the White Ferns.
The Kiwis, who beat India in their opening match, started slowly and once Kerr was dismissed for 29, the innings fell apart as nine wickets fell for 29 runs.
Schutt took her tally to six wickets in the tournament while Annabel Sutherland also chipped in with 3-21.
""We needed to have a good start and we let the run rate creep up too much,"" said Kiwi captain Sophie Devine. ""We've still got two games to go.""
Australia play Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday while New Zealand face Sri Lanka in Sharjah on Saturday.

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
England finished the second day of the first Test in Multan on a solid 96-1 on Tuesday in reply to Pakistan's mammoth 556 that was boosted by a fiery century from Agha Salman.
The tourists lost stand-in skipper Ollie Pope for a second-ball duck before Zak Crawley and Joe Root steadied the innings with 64 and 32 respectively at stumps.
It was another tough day for bowlers as an unbeaten 104 from Salman and 82 by Saud Shakeel swelled Pakistan's total, which was set up by Shan Masood's 151 and Abdullah Shafique's 102 on Monday.
Pope, standing in for injured skipper Ben Stokes, was smartly caught by a leaping Aamer Jamal who plucked an uppish pull shot off pacer Naseem Shah with one hand at mid-wicket.
He had been drafted in to open the batting after Ben Duckett injured his left thumb taking a catch at the end of the Pakistan innings.
England need another 261 to avoid a follow-on -- a task eminently achievable on a pitch offering no help to bowlers.
Salman built on the good work of Shakeel and Naseem in the afternoon, reaching his third century with a single off spinner Jack Leach soon after the tea interval.
Salman, who also completed 1,000 Test runs during this knock when he reached 71, added a rapid 85 for the ninth wicket with Shaheen Shah Afridi, who scored 26.
In all, Salman cracked 10 boundaries and three sixes in his 119-ball knock -- surviving a catch by Chris Woakes when the third umpire declared the fielder's foot went beyond the rope.
""It's always satisfying to hit a century and contribute to the team's total,"" said Salman, who hoped the pitch would take spin in the next three days.
""I think cracks will open on this pitch and that will help spinners, I see this as a result-oriented pitch as both the teams will go for a result.""
Salman added an invaluable 57 runs for the seventh wicket with Shakeel, who was caught smartly by Root at slip off Bashir for 82. Shakeel hit eight fours.
Leach was the most successful England bowler with 3-160, while Gus Atkinson finished with 2-99. Woakes, Shoaib Bashir and Root took one wicket apiece.
Pace bowler Brydon Carse took 2-74 on debut after trapping Jamal for seven. His first Test wicket was Naseem, caught at leg slip by Harry Brook before lunch for 33.
Carse said England's bowlers were made to toil on an unresponsive pitch.
""The last two days were immensely tough conditions for everyone out there,"" he said. ""To be able to pick up a couple of wickets today is rewarding.""
""It's been a tough graft but credit to the players for keep coming back.""
The remaining Tests are in Multan (October 15-19) and Rawalpindi (October 24-28).

The start of the 2024-25 football season has been deferred to late November owing to the unprepared grounds for the Bangladesh Premier League.
The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of Professional League Management Committee [PLMC] on Tuesday.
""The proposed venues of the upcoming season have not been prepared yet, which is why we have deferred the season which was supposed to start on October 11. The season will start in the latter part of November following requests from clubs as well as considering the overall situation,"" PLMC chairman and BFF vice-president Imrun Hasan in a video message following the virtual meeting.
The deferral means the season, which will comprise of Challenge Cup, Federation Cup and Bangladesh Premier League, will start after the much-hyped BFF elections on October 26.
The upcoming season was supposed to get underway with the one-off Challenge Cup match between league champions Bashundhara Kings and runners-up Mohammedan, while the Federation Cup and Bangladesh Premier League were supposed to get underway on October 15 and October 18 respectively.
The clubs had previously demanded at least eight weeks for the pre-season preparation but the PLMC had decided to start the season on October 11, deferring the first scheduled date of season's start by a week.
""We are hoping to make all venues playable in this timeframe to start the season in late November,"" Hasan added.

Bangladesh batter Mahmudullah Riyad said on Tuesday that he had no regrets looking back on his career after the 38-year-old announced he willretirefrom T20Is after the completion of the ongoing three-match T20I series against India.
""No, never. I have never ever regretted at any stage or point of my life playing for Bangladesh,"" Mahmudullah told reporters in the pre-match press conference ahead of the second T20I in Delhi tomorrow.
""I've always said to myself and my team as well, I always want to be a team man no matter who the oppositions are. I tried to do it for the team. But I never regretted it. Never.""
""I have no regrets, not a single bit. I think playing for Bangladesh for so many years, quite a good thing personally. As much as I've played T20Is, I probably made my debut in 2007, it's been 17 years. I don't know how good I could do for the team, but I tried my level best. I tried to serve the team.""
There had been speculations about the 38-year-old's future in the T20I side which is aiming to find their feet for the 2026 T20 World Cup. It only intensified after skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto promised ""a new approach"" and hinted that the veteran may discuss his future with the selectors ahead of the first match.
Mahmudullah, who made his T20I debut in 2007, has played 139 matches for Bangladesh, the most for the country, amassing 2395 runs – the second-highest after Shakib Al Hasan's 2551 - at an average of 23.48 and a strike rate of 117.74.

Former Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta, who won two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup with an all-conquering Spain team, announced his retirement from football on Tuesday at the age of 40.
""Being on the pitch is over,"" a visibly emotional Iniesta told reporters at a news conference in Barcelona while reflecting on a professional career that began with the Catalan giants in 2002.
""I can't stay away from football, it's my life and will continue to be my life. Now I need to continue educating myself, I'm in the process of doing my coaching diploma and that's the next step.""
""I will try to come back and do a great job. However it won't be running after the ball, but from another place,"" he added.
Iniesta came up through Barcelona's famed La Masia academy and made his first-team debut aged just 18, becoming a mainstay in the midfield before his departure 16 years later after 674 appearances.
He won nine La Liga titles and the Champions League four times with Barcelona, also lifting six Copas del Rey in a haul of 32 trophies during his time at Camp Nou.
Iniesta formed a devastating midfield with Xavi Hernandez and Sergio Busquets, becoming the standard-bearers of the ""tiki-taka"" style of football that catapulted both club and country to new heights.
He played alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Samuel Eto'o and Luis Suarez for Barcelona, who captured the treble in 2009 under Pep Guardiola and again six years later with Luis Enrique in charge.
Messi paid tribute to Iniesta on social media and called him ""one of the most magical team-mates"", while Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said he had given ""society an example of what a professional athlete is"".
His greatest moment came in the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg when he scored the winning goal for Spain against the Netherlands in extra time.
He won 131 caps for Spain before calling time on his international career after the 2018 World Cup.
After leaving Barcelona in 2018, Iniesta spent five years with Japanese club Vissel Kobe before playing one final season with Emirates of the UAE.
""I'd like to return to Barca at some point. Not just to say it, but because those who had so much influence, in one way or another, have to be there,"" said Iniesta.
""When I can do what I did as a player in another role at the club... I'd be delighted.""
Barcelona praised the retiring Iniesta in a post on the club's X account.
""Iniesta, your football will live on forever.""

A democratic transition has emerged as a prerequisite for an inclusive and sustainable economy, said a noted economist today.
Debapriya Bhattacharya, convener of the Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, made the comments while making a presentation at a book launching event at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh in the capital.
The economist said a lack of overall democratic accountability and good governance led to the failure of public institutions and protecting the rights of disadvantaged groups and citizens.
This stemmed from a lack of resources in prioritised sectors and areas, poor implementation of policies and projects, and inconsistency between policy formulation and development planning, he said.
CPD Chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan, former Executive Director of Ain o Salish Kendra and former caretaker government Sultana Kamal, Bangla Academy President Selina Hossain, Theatre Activist Mamunur Rashid and CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman, also spoke.

The US said it is taking steps to impose visa restrictions on individuals and aid cuts in response to Cambodia's national election, which Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party won in a landslide after his most credible rivals were disqualified.
The United States said the party's stifling of the opposition meant the vote could not be considered free or fair.
Autocratic leader Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 120 of 125 available seats in Sunday's elections, according to preliminary results.
Ahead of Sunday's election, the unofficial successor to the CNRP, known as the Candlelight Party, was barred on a technicality from running in the election by the National Election Committee.
The US, the European Union and other Western countries refused to send observers to the election, saying it lacked the conditions to be considered free and fair. Russia and China were among those that did send observers.
Late Sunday, the US State Department said it had ""taken steps"" to impose visa restrictions ""on individuals who undermined democracy and implemented a pause of foreign assistance programs"" after determining the elections were ""neither free nor fair.""
""Cambodian authorities engaged in a pattern of threats and harassment against the political opposition, media, and civil society that undermined the spirit of the country's constitution and Cambodia's international obligations,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
""These actions denied the Cambodian people a voice and a choice in determining the future of their country.""
Michael Greenwald, spokesman for the US Embassy in Phnom Penh, yesterday said the visa restrictions would be placed on people involved in ""threatening and harassing the political opposition, media and civil society"" but he would not specify who or how many individuals that would entail.
Similarly, he would not elaborate on the scope of the pause of foreign assistance programs, saying only that it involved ""several"" new activities, and noting that the US had contributed some $3 billion dollars to programs over the last 30 years.
The State Department urged the CPP to use its new term to restore ""genuine multi-party democracy.""
Regional advocacy group Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights called on all democracies to denounce the elections.

BNP's secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir today said the ruling Awami League is trying to create a confrontational situation by rescheduling their rally on the same day as BNP's ""mega rally"".
He also warned that the government will have to take responsibility if any violence occurs at BNP's grand rally on July 27.
The comment comes as tensions are building ahead of the rival rallies – one by BNP and one by Jubo League -- on July 27.
""The Jubo League had a program scheduled for 24th July. After we announced our program, they rescheduled it to 27th July. It is clear that they did it to create a conflict,"" Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told the reporters after a joint meeting at the party office in Nayapaltan.
""If any kind of violent incident happens, the government will have to take responsibility,"" he warned.
Claiming that special persons of the government are speaking provocatively, Mirza Fakhrul told reporters that, ""You must have noticed that for the last few days, the government's ministers have been giving threats.""
""It [threats] cannot be accepted. All the movements we have done so far, every movement has been peaceful,"" he added.
Mirza Fakhrul said that an application has been submitted to the Dhaka Metropolitan Police seeking permission for the venue of the grand rally.
'I hope they will provide a final decision regarding our rally location today,' he said.
Before Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir's speech, senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi delivered the opening speech.
Joint Secretary General Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal, Dhaka North BNP Convener Amanullah Aman, Dhaka South BNP Convener Abdus Salam, and other senior leaders were present at the meeting.

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
The EDRU Study Group, comprising a team of young researchers, has recently published a unique research journal on the topic of identity and violence. What sets this journal apart is its collaborative nature, involving current students and alumni, under the guidance of professors Abdullah Al-Mamun and Maswod Akhter. The initiative aims to foster the research capabilities of the present students of the English department of Rajshahi University by providing mentorship from experienced teachers and alumni.
For the alumni pursuing teaching careers, this group serves as an ideal platform to enhance their research skills and contribute to the country's scholarly literature. Notably, the researchers have mostly chosen indigenous Bangla literature as their subject of study, despite graduating in English literature. However, the medium of study remains English, offering an opportunity to raise awareness and interest in Bangla and South Asian literature among the English-speaking community.
The publication itself is a special issue ofPraxis, the journal of the Department of English at Rajshahi University, focusing on the theme of Identity and Violence. The journal explores the intricate relationship between identity and violence through multidisciplinary perspectives, encompassing fields such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, and politics.
The group is currently running another research project on Partition (1947 & 1971), and the researchers have selected their topics and submitted them to the editors, who are scrutinizing them right now.
The journal issue begins by providing an overview of the concept of identity, discussing how it is shaped by a variety of factors, including race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation. The authors then discuss how identity can be a source of both conflict and violence. They argue that when identity is threatened or challenged, it can lead to anger, resentment, and fear, which can lead to violence.'
Professor Abdullah Al Mamun begins his note on violence in this way: ""In classical/traditional epistemological and ontological discourses, violence is usually placed in opposition to reason. Violence and reason are considered as mutually exclusive and violence is perceived as antagonistic to truth, language, and logos.""
But Abdullah Al Mamun repudiates the binary of reason and violence saying that it is not (and never was) as smooth as it seems to be. The way he sets the framework of the research initiative is that violence has to be understood in a given spatiotemporal matrix or analyzed and categorized by understanding its specific aspects in a historical context. More specifically, he charts out some associations-nation and violence, race and violence, gender and violence, religion and violence, class, and violence, etc.-under the umbrella of which, the young researchers have carried out their exploration of identity and violence, and to do so, they deployed different theoretical frameworks.
Of them, Walter Benjamin has been widely referred to by researchers to make their points on violence and identity. According to Benjamin, ""All violence as a means is either lawmaking or law preserving"". However, law-making violence can also be seen as somewhat identical with the concept of Mythic violence as it bears the ambiguity of myth which ultimately leaves this kind of violence to be burdened with ""fate"".
Some of the key findings of the journal articles are thus: Identity is a complex and multifaceted concept that is shaped by a variety of factors, including race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation. Identity can be a source of both conflict and violence. When identity is threatened or challenged, it can lead to anger, resentment, and fear, which can lead to violence. Violence is often used as a way to maintain or challenge social hierarchies, and it can be used to oppress or marginalize marginalized groups. It is, therefore, essential to understand the complex relationship between identity and violence to develop effective interventions to prevent violence and promote peace.
Umme Kulsum Prosun, in her article ""Tracing the Roots of Violence: A Psychoanalytic Study of Syed Waliullah'sTree without Roots, sheds light on the way Majeed, one of the most famous characters in the realm of the Bangla novel (Lal Salu)uses violence to serve his purposes. She says, Majeed at the beginning of the novel commits a violent act just after entering Mahabbatpur as he fraudulently claims an unknown grave to be a holy shrine and becomes its self-proclaimed caretaker. This very act is a form of law-making violence as he uses the name of God wrongly to instill fear in people to control them.
Mohammad Saeid Hassan Khan, in his article titled ""The Becoming of Manasa: Violence as a Means of Establishing Desired Identity in Manasamangal Kavyas"", reflects on the violent approaches carried out by Manasa in formatting her desired identity and explained the correlation between identity and violence in Manasamangal Kavyas.
As her father Shiva was unaware of her identity, Manasa, a kind of outcast, resorted to violence to establish her identity.
""As the law of the society was not ready to give her due recognition and Manasa had to act to set the law anew, her actions were bound to be violent to fight the existing law"", Saeid writes, ""In the divine realm, the main obstacle for Manasa to attain her identity was Chandi, because Manasa wanted to secure her place as a legitimate daughter in Shiva's abode, but Shiva's wife Chandi was not willing to acknowledge her. Shiva's first wife Chandi is the lawmaker in Shiva's household. So, Manasa had to struggle against Chandi's 'law-preserving violence' to secure a place there in Kailasa. There Manasa had to carry out 'mythic violence' as a demonstration of her power.""
Apart from literary criticism, this issue ofPraxisalso features one ethnographic article on the Mijos and another critical article on the plight of the Rohingyas. In the southern region, right on the border of Bangladesh, two ethnic groups have endured persecution at the hands of their respective state authorities. The continuous mistreatment and discrimination faced by these communities have created a challenging environment for their survival and well-being.
Bokhtiar Ahmed, a  professor from the Department of Anthropology, University of Rajshahi, renders an ethnographic portrayal of the disjointed existence of the Pangkhuas who live along the Bangladesh-India border, while historically disarticulated from their self-recognition as the Zo people. They form one of the smaller groups among the indigenous Jumma people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) who struggle to survive as 'Bangladeshi', 'Jumma' or 'Pangkhua' in this geopolitical margin of the Bangladeshi state.
This is a portrayal of how an indigenous community lost their historical selves at the crossroads of two state-making projects. But the hegemony of the state projects is so strong that, as Bakhtiar observes, ""surprisingly it hardly bothers my Pangkhua friends who are quite happy to introduce themselves as 'Pangkhua' and never forget to write it as a surname in documents.They or their cross-bordered relatives from Mizoram also seem to have no trouble with how Mizoram is graphed in statistical figures. All they know is that they were part of a 'Zo' people who have been living in this mountainous terrain from time immemorial. The historical emergence of the state has divided themselves and soil."" So, state violence caused them to forget their identities to a certain extent.
Reference to celebrity historian Yuval Noah Harari is relevant here. Harari asserts inSapiens: A Brief History of Humankindthat violence has been a significant force throughout human history, playing a crucial role in the rise and fall of civilizations. He explores how both individuals and groups have utilized violence to establish dominance, conquer territories, and assert power over others. From ancient conflicts to modern warfare, Harari delves into the various forms of violence that have shaped human civilization.
Harari also explores the connection between violence and human nature. While acknowledging that humans have the capacity for aggression and violence, he argues that violence is not an inherent or unchangeable aspect of our species. Instead, he suggests that it is shaped by social, cultural, and environmental factors. By understanding these factors and actively working to address them, societies can strive to create conditions that reduce violence and promote harmony.
Rakibul Alam, another researcher from the group, in his article titled ""Violence and Its Ramifications: Exploring Theory"" sheds light on some fundamental aspects of human nature and violence: We are most likely living in one of the most violent eras in human history, he writes, in which violence, tragically, has become the only 'toxic glue' that holds mankind together. As a result, in today's socio-political environment, we are practically compelled to see violence as a necessary condition of modern reality, even if not the ""original sin of politics"" itself.
The essay emphasizes the instrumentalization of ""the other"" in acts of violence and the role of violence in shaping social and political structures. It argues that violence serves as a means of closure, normalizing existing systems and suppressing alternative possibilities.
One strength of the essay is its recognition of violence as a metaphysical category, encompassing both ideology and material manifestations. The analysis of violence as a state of mind (keeping in line with Henner Hess) that perpetuates hierarchies and subjugation is insightful. It acknowledges the complex dynamics of violence and identity formation, emphasizing the role of language and discourse in shaping individual and collective identities.
The researchers in this volume have engaged with a variety of texts, including Joseph Conrad's works such asThe Secret AgentandUnder the Western Eyes, Tarashankar Bondopaddhay'sKobi, the works of Kazi Nazrul Islam, Jibanananda Das, Rudra Muhammad Shahidullah, as well as selected poems by William Blake. Additionally, the volume features articles on An Introduction by Kamala Das, Memoirs of Abul Mansur Ahmad, andThe Dark Holds No Terrorby Sahahi Deshpande, among others.
It is worth considering that, according to historian Yuval Noah Harari, we may not be able to fully evade violence, as our evolutionary past has instilled certain inclinations within us that could be linked to violence.Why identity, and why it mattersRoots, a novel by Alex Haley, explores the theme of identity. The story follows the life of Kunta Kinte, an African man captured and sold into slavery in America, and his descendants.One of the central themes in the novel is the search for identity. Kunta Kinte, as a young man from the Mandinka tribe in Africa, has a strong sense of his cultural heritage and personal identity. However, upon being enslaved and transported to America, he is stripped of his name, language, and traditions, and is forced to adopt a new identity as Toby.Throughout the book, Kunta Kinte's struggle to maintain his sense of self and reclaim his African roots becomes a powerful narrative. He tries to pass on his heritage and traditions to his daughter, Kizzy, and subsequent generations, fostering a sense of connection to their African ancestry despite the oppressive circumstances of slavery.Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate in economics and a philosopher, said the perception of identity has done much to generate and sustain demand for justice and fairness. For example, the movements for women's rights have drawn heavily on the sense of feminine identity. He even goes on to say that the world would have been a much-impoverished place without the social and political commitment of being directly inspired by the identity of disadvantaged people.Sen further argues that a sense of identity can be a source not merely of pride and joy, which it certainly is, but also a source of confidence and strength, and yet it can also kill with abandon. So identity can be a powerful force for good, but it can also be used to justify violence.Read moreAmartya Sen’s ‘Home in the World’: The life of an intellectualHe identifies two main ways in which identity can be used to justify violence. The first is through the idea of ""us versus them."" This is the idea that there is a fundamental conflict between our group and another group. This conflict can be based on religion, ethnicity, nationality, or other shared characteristics. When we see the world in terms of ""us versus them,"" it is easy to dehumanize the other group and to see them as a threat. This can lead to violence, as we try to protect ourselves from the perceived threat.Amartya Sen emphasizes the need to critically examine the historical reality that all wars, or struggles for power, fundamentally arise within the context of contesting identities. This becomes particularly relevant in our era of rapid globalization, where different cultures are increasingly coming into contact with and influencing one another. Throughout history, conflicts have consistently been sparked by perceptions of self and others.The Rohingyas are perhaps the most extreme examples of how identity can be used to justify violence. The Rohingyas, dubbed by the Buddhist majority Burmese people of Myanmar as an 'outsider', have been subjected to ethnic violence for a long time, which had culminated in the most extreme form in the last decade and even went to the extent of evicting them of their homesteads where they stayed for more than a millennium.Read moreKaamil Ahmed publishes ‘first book-length exploration’ of Rohingya lives abroadMaswood Akhter, the co-editor of the volume, renders a picture depicting the misery of the lives of the stateless Rohingyas, who have been pushed to the Bangladesh territory by the Myanmar army. The essay presents a critical evaluation of the Rohingya tragedy, describing it as a major humanitarian crisis that resulted from a systematic plan of persecution and exclusion by fascist, fanatic, and racist regimes in Myanmar. The author highlights the acts of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and other brutalities committed against the Rohingya people, leading to a massive refugee crisis with nearly one million Rohingyas in refugee camps in Bangladesh.The author argues that the international community has largely ignored the warning signs and failed to take effective action to prevent the atrocities. They criticize the weak and inconsistent pressure exerted by powerful nations, which prioritizes trade and economic interests over human rights. The essay also raises concerns about the complicity of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace laureate and leader of Myanmar's democratic government, who is accused of subscribing to anti-Muslim prejudice and failing to address the suffering of the Rohingya.Lenin, state, and violenceRakibul is laudable for his attempt to put violence in a theoretical frame, but what is so conspicuously missing in his article is any reference to Vladimir Lenin and his famous book,State & Revolution, where he sanctified the necessity of violence for securing the class interest of the proletariat.Lenin advocated for the use of revolutionary violence to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, a transitional phase in which the working class would seize political power and dismantle the capitalist state. He argued that this dictatorship was necessary to suppress counter-revolutionary forces and protect the gains of the revolution. Lenin emphasized that the violence employed by the proletariat was different from the violence of the capitalist state, as it aimed to liberate the oppressed and create a more just society.However, it is important to note that Lenin's views on violence were not without controversy. Critics argue that his revolutionary zeal and the subsequent implementation of his ideas in the Soviet Union led to significant human rights abuses and authoritarianism. The use of violence by the state under Lenin's leadership, including the Red Terror and the suppression of political opponents, has been heavily criticized.The fact remains that throughout history, various political groups have resorted to violence in their pursuit of advancing their causes, often justifying it as necessary for the greater good of humankind. The legacy continues to persist, with the Rohingya community facing persecution under similar pretexts, just like the Kurds in the Middle East, Muslims, and other communities around the world. Hitler's infamous pursuit to annihilate the Jewish people was fueled by his deep-seated hatred for the community, driven by his desire to establish the supremacy of his race and identity. Visiting the concentration camps now where the Jewish were subjected to merciless persecution is an overwhelmingly harrowing experience, as attested by numerous visitors and reviewers to the reviewer.Read more‘We are the only species to have threatened life on the planet’: Dipesh ChakrabartyHowever, it is worth considering that, according to historian Yuval Noah Harari, we may not be able to fully evade violence, as our evolutionary past has instilled certain inclinations within us that could be linked to violence. Harari recognizes that our ancestors encountered violent obstacles in their fight for survival, and these encounters may have left a lasting impact on certain aspects of our behaviour. In essence, the potential for violence exists within us, and eliminating that potential necessitates an ongoing struggle for humanity, which can be viewed as a form of violence.Parents sometimes employ certain forms of discipline to assert authority over their children, despite holding a deep affection for them. This serves as evidence that violence permeates various aspects of society. Nevertheless, Harari advises against reducing human nature to a fixed set of violent instincts, emphasizing the significant role played by cultural and social influences in moulding our behaviour.In conclusion, the research journal on identity and violence published by the EDRU Study Group presents a critical approach to understanding the complex relationship between identity and violence. The young researchers, under the guidance of professors Abdullah Al-Mamun and Maswod Akhter, have delved into multidisciplinary perspectives to explore this theme.The journal highlights that identity is a multifaceted concept influenced by race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation. It emphasizes that identity can be a source of conflict and violence, as individuals and groups may feel threatened or challenged, leading to anger, resentment, and fear that can escalate into violence.Through the analysis of literary works, such asManasamangal Kavyasand Syed Waliullah'sTree without Roots,the researchers examine how characters employ violence to establish their desired identities. They also explore the role of violence in maintaining social hierarchies and marginalizing certain groups.Ultimately, the journal prompts us to consider the enduring presence of violence in human history and its connection to identity. It reminds us that violence has been utilized by various groups throughout time, and although efforts should be made to reduce violence, it remains an ever-present aspect of our society. By understanding the complexities of violence and identity, we can work towards creating a more peaceful and just world.Protik Bardhanis a professional journalist, with a penchant for excellence in the fields of journalism, translation, and writing.

Activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) locked into a clash on Dhaka University campus yesterday morning.
JCD activists claimed that BCL men attacked them when they were holding a scheduled programme. BCL activists denied the allegation.
The clash took place two days after Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader expressed fear of possible ""instability"" in educational institutions as they are preparing to reopen the institutions.
Rakibul Islam Rakib, convener of JCD's DU unit, told The Daily Star that they brought out a procession from Central Shaheed Minar around 10am, protesting the arrests of organising secretary of JCD central committee Saif Mahmud Jewel and assistant organising secretary Moshiur Rahman Rony.
BCL men attacked the procession when it reached near TSC, Rakib claimed, adding that at least 15 JCD activists were injured in the attack.
Among the injured, two were undergoing treatment
at Dhaka Medical College Hospital while the rest at other hospitals.
Later they held a press conference at Dhaka University Journalists' Association and demanded punishment of the attackers.
Contacted, Saddam Hossain, general secretary of BCL's DU chapter, said Chhatra League activists are now busy with humanitarian activities during the pandemic and they have no involvement with the incident.
Asked, DU proctor Prof Dr AKM Golam Rabbani said no one has lodged any complaint over the incident yet.
""I heard that an organistaion came to the campus to hold programmes without our permission amid this closure. I request everyone to be responsible and refrain from any such activity that will create unrest on campus,"" he added.

The income of ruling Awami League in 2020 was about Tk 10.33 crore, 51 percent down from that of 2019, according to its audited financial statement submitted to the Election Commission yesterday.
However, AL's expenditures increased by Tk 1.73 crore last year, compared to that of the previous year, reports UNB.
The party's total income was Tk 10,33,43,33 in 2020, which was over Tk 21 crore in 2019.
An AL team, led by its publicity and publication secretary Dr Abdus Sobhan Golap, MP, handed over the financial statement of the 2020 calendar year to EC Secretary Md Humayun Kabir Khandaker at Nirbachan Bhaban in the city.
Later, Golap told reporters that their party's income largely came from the subscriptions of its members, sale of nomination forms and donations from various individuals and organisations. In 2020, the income declined as it earned less from the sale of nomination forms, and there was no income from the triennial council of the party in 2019.
AL spent Tk 9,94,49,931 in the calendar year, Tk 1,73,48,356 more than it spent in 2019. The expenditures went up for conducting relief activities amid the Covid-19 pandemic, providing donations to party-nominated candidates in different elections and the rise in the expenses against different publications.
On Thursday, BNP submitted its 2020 financial statement before the EC. The party's income was Tk 1.23 crore and expenditure was Tk 1.75 crore in 2020. The additional expenditure was met from its previous fund.
As per the law, each registered political party is obliged to submit its financial statement of the previous calendar year by July 31. But this time, EC has extended the time till August 31 due to Covid-19.

BNP activists and police personnel clashed at Dhaka's Chandrima Udyan this morning, leaving several injured.
The clash started around 10:30 am when the newly formed convening committees of BNP's Dhaka city north and south units went to place wreaths at the grave of the party's founder Ziaur Rahman.
Both BNP and police blamed each other for the clash. Some, including police personnel, were injured as BNP activists threw brickbats at the law enforcers who charged batons and fired tear gas canisters to disperse them, witnesses said.
Of the injured, two BNP leaders -- organising secretary of BNP Tejgaon Thana Unit Moniruzzaman Tagor and former president of BNP Kamrangircahr Thana Unit Abul Kalam Azad -- were rushed to Dhaka medical College Hospital with pellet injuries.
Moniruzzaman and Abul Kalam alleged that they were injured when police fired from their shotguns.
BNP leader Amanullah Aman alleged that police stopped BNP leaders and activists when they were going to Chandrima Udyan to observe their prescheduled programme peacefully. Police chased them and fired rubber bullets, agitating the activists.
""Police attacked us without any provocation. Several persons including BNP Dhaka city north unit's member secretary Aminul Haque were injured in the attack,"" he alleged.
Jane Alam Munshi, officer-in-charge of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station, said BNP activists attacked police out of the blue and at least seven police personnel were injured.
""We brought the situation under control later on,"" he said.

BNP has called upon the government to form a crisis-time advisory committee comprised of health experts, all political parties, NGOs and social organisations, and take coordinated steps towards curbing the transmission of Covid-19 across the country.
Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the party's secretary general, came up with the demands while addressing a virtual press conference today.
""Although it is late, a crisis-time advisory committee comprising health experts, all political parties, NGOs and social organisations should be formed soon,"" Fakhrul said.
The party's other demands included encouraging people to follow health guidelines and wear masks, formulating a coordinated and specific roadmap for vaccinating 80 percent of the population and making it public, taking immediate and effective measures to produce vaccine locally, and ensuring adequate healthcare facilities in the hospitals.
Fakhrul said these issues should be set as target to curb the transmission of coronavirus.
""We have to keep in mind that the fight against Covid-19 pandemic is a long-term one,"" he added.
The party also urged the government to provide Tk 15,000 cash assistance each to the poor along with food to make sure they stay home in order to make the lockdown effective.
The BNP secretary general said the government can provide humanitarian support to the poor of the country using six to seven percent of the GDP.
As resources are limited, the developed countries focused on prevention of Covid-19 so that the healthcare system does not become overburdened.""What is badly needed is good intention and cordiality,"" he added.

Top leaders of Hefajat-e-Islam today demanded that the government release its ""innocent"" leaders and activists arrested since March 25.
The Hefajat leaders including its amir, Junayed Babunagari, and Secretary General Nurul Islam Jihadi made the demand while meeting Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal at the latter's Dhanmondi residence, meeting sources told The Daily Star.
The meeting that started around 8:15pm lasted for over two hours, Morshed bin Noor, son of Nurul Islam Jihadi, told The Daily Star after leaving the meeting.
He added that the meeting discussed various issues, including the release of detained Hefajat leaders and asking that its leaders and activists not be arrested.
A Hefajat leader said they also demanded that the government reopen all Qawmi madrasas.
There was no formal briefing to reporters from any side.
Despite repeated attempts, the home minister did not answer his mobile phone.
The government took a tough stance following Hefajat's violence spanning three days since March 25 in protest of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in Bangladesh. The violence surrounding the protest left at least 17 people dead and many others injured.
Hefajat has been under tremendous pressure from the government to restructure its central committee since the mayhem in late March, sources said.
At least 154 cases were filed against Hefajat men in the following days while around 1,230 people, including more than 50 top Hefajat leaders, were arrested, according to Police Headquarters data.
Following the recent crackdown on Hefajat, some of its leaders started trying to negotiate with the government in hopes of avoiding ""arrest and harassment"".
Hefajat's previous central committee was disbanded on April 25 amid a government crackdown on Hefajat leaders following the organisation's violence across the country in late March.
A five-member convening committee headed by Junayed and Nurul as its amir and member-secretary was formed at the time.
On June 8, Nurul Islam Jihadi announced the 33-member new central committee, a 16-member advisory committee and another committee called Majlish-e-Sura comprising nine members.
The new committee did not include Mamunul Haque and other leaders who are involved with different political parties or are in jail on charges of being involved in the violence in late March.
In the new committee Junayed Babunagari and Nurul Islam Jihadi continued to be the amir and secretary general of the Islamist organisation.
In November 2020, around two months after the death of Hefajat chief Shah Ahmad Shafi, Babunagari and Nur Hossain Kasemi were named as the new amir and secretary general respectively.
Nurul Islam was made the secretary general after Kasemi died in December.
The government allegedly had influenced while the formation of the new committee, making sure the individuals involved in political parties associated with the BNP are axed, said Hefajat leaders.
The Islamist organisation first made headlines in 2009 by protesting a draft national women development policy that provided equal inheritance rights to women.
It is often said that hostility between Hefajat and the AL government turned amicable through closed-door negotiations amid a government crackdown after Hefajat's mayhem in the capital in May, 2013.

Ruling Awami League's senior lawmaker Tofail Ahmed and Jatiya Party MP Kazi Firoz Rashid in parliament today expressed their frustration and anger over the growing presence of government bureaucrats in various jobs without importance being given to politicians.
Speaking on the proposed budget for 2021-22, Tofail said, ""I'm sorry, I don't know how reasonable it would be to say that. Now the administrative officer has been given the responsibility in our district. People think that all the help we gave to them during coronavirus was given by administrative officials.""
""But the administrative officials did not even go to the area. The person who has been given responsibility in my area didn't even come for a day,"" he said.
The veteran politician said, ""It is unfortunate-- there is not a single MP in this parliament who did not stand by the poor and distressed during this coronavirus period…I have given relief to 40,000 people in my area. But people think that administrative officials have given all of these.""
He said the authority and job of politicians has faded away today. The minister also said that according to the warrant of precedence, MPs position is above that of secretaries.
""We need officials from the administration, but not in exclusion of politicians,"" he said.
Tofail said politicians are elected representatives and they should have a specific standing and jobs and should remain there.
At the beginning of his speech, Jatiya Party MP Kazi Firoz Rashid also echoed Tofail Amed's sentiments.
He said there is no politics in the country today and Tofail Ahmed has pointed out the issue rightly.
Firoz said the prime minister spoke to Deputy Commissioners at different programmes but MPs in those programmed remained at a distance. And after the programmed ended MPs would have to request DCs to talk a little with the prime minister.
The senior Jatiya Party MP said, ""the political arenas are slowly being occupied by businessmen. Who is running the country? Businessmen and bureaucrats are running the country.""
""We politicians are now standing in the third line. This is our bad luck. But this country has been liberated by politicians,"" he added.

BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir today described the nationwide lockdown announced by the government to contain Coronavirus spread as a 'joke' since it repeatedly failed to fully enforce such restrictions in recent times.
""The government has again announced a lockdown for seven days, which has now turned into a joke. It's now saying the lockdown will be enforced from Thursday instead of Monday. It's a joke,"" said Fakhrul.
He said, ""The lockdown has become completely ineffective due to the incompetence and irresponsibility of the government. Lockdown can never be fruitful without ensuring food for the poor and day-labourers and transferring cash to the workers in the informal sector.""
The BNP leader came up with the remarks while speaking at a press conference at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office on the outcomes of the party standing committee's virtual meeting held yesterday.
Asked why he considers the lockdown ""a joke"", Fakhrul said the government first announced a general holiday and then enforced a lockdown last year. ""It's been seen many workers went back home with the announcement of the holiday and they came back again. They (govt) now announced a lockdown when there's a lockdown in place. Isn't it a joke?""
He said the government has shut inter-district transport services from the capital without any proper plan. ""That's why many people are leaving Dhaka and many others are returning here from different districts on foot taking the seven-day lockdown as holidays.""
Stating that the people of Bangladesh are very witty, Fakhrul said they are joking about the strict lockdown and other terms.
He said their party thinks it will not be possible to deal with the spread of the deadly virus without the active participation of people. ""People will go out of their homes in search of work, out of hunger. In fact, the government has no well-planned programme on the Covid-19.""
Taking a swipe at Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader for his comments about the ""bleak future"" of BNP, Fakhrul questioned why the ruling party leaders are so concerned about BNP. ""I would like to say the future of Awami League is very dark because of their misdeeds...the ruling party leaders won't find an escape route if people wake up.""

When asked about Khaleda Zia's condition, Fakhrul said, ""She is feeling better.""

""Every day, she (Khaleda Zia) has check-ups,"" said Fakhrul, adding, ""The check-ups are performed by a team of physicians led by Dr AFM Siddique and AZM Zahid Hossain. From now on, the entire team will see her once a week.""

On June 20, a meeting of the BNP's standing committee, chaired by the party's acting chairman Tarique Rahman, demanded that the government allow the BNP chairperson treatment overseas as soon as possible. The issue was also discussed at a standing committee meeting yesterday, with the chairperson's physical condition being highlighted.

Earlier, after 53 days of treatment at Bashundhara's Evercare Hospital, Khaleda Zia returned to her Gulshan home on June 19.

Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
For the first time, Bangladesh has bagged more than 4 crore tonnes of rice in a fiscal year (FY) thanks to increasing yields of the most grown crop, according to official data.
Local farmers have been gradually switching to high-yielding and hybrid varieties of the cereal grain, bringing the country's need for rice imports down to zero.
Estimates by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) show that farmers bagged 4.06 crore tonnes of rice in FY 2023-24, up by 4.1 percent year-on-year in what was the highest growth in six years.
The largest growth in yields came from Aman paddy, which was harvested in the previous winter ahead of Boro paddy in the dry season. Boro is the principal rice crop in Bangladesh.
Farmers got about 2.10 crore tonnes of rice through the Boro harvest in the May-June period early this calendar year.
FY24 marked the fifth year of a consistent rise in rice production with Wais Kabir, a former executive chairman of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council, linking the spike to yield enhancement.
""One of the main factors is that farmers have shifted to cultivating modern varieties of rice. They are growing more high-yielding and hybrid varieties. The acreage has also risen over time,"" he said.
Jahangir Alam, an agricultural economist, said increased rice production cut import of the cereal grain.
""We did not have to import any rice [in FY24]. Besides, this did not have much of an impact on prices as it seems public and private stocks were adequate,"" Kabir added.
Data of the food ministry shows that Bangladesh imported 10.56 lakh tonnes of rice in FY23 compared to zero public and private imports as of October 7 this year.
Kabir also said one of the reasons behind the zero rice imports was a surge in wheat imports.
The use of wheat by bakery and food processing industries as well as animal feed has increased. This contributed to the reduced requirement for rice, he added.
Imports of wheat, the second most consumed cereal grain after rice, soared 71 percent year-on-year to 66 lakh tonnes in FY24.
M Asaduzzman, a professorial fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies expressed doubt over the rice production estimate.
He questioned why prices have gone up if supply was indeed adequate.
""Production has not risen as much as reported. Higher prices mean there is a supply shortage,"" he said, adding that rice accounts for a good portion of food inflation, which was high in the previous fiscal.
The BBS said food inflation rose to 10.65 percent in FY24 from 8.71 percent the year prior.
The price of rice coarse rice, the cheapest variety, was 7 percent higher year-on-year at Tk 50 to Tk 55 per kilogramme in Dhaka yesterday.
Asaduzzman informed that recurrent floods this year have raised concerns over the cultivation of Aman.
""We will have to import rice if Aman production suffers. And that will be clear at the beginning of November. So, the government should take a decision regarding imports next month,"" he said.
By the end of August, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said Aus and Aman rice acreage and production in Bangladesh might decline because of the floods, particularly the devastating deluge in the eastern part of the country.
Estimates by the Department of Agricultural Extension show that Aman acreage declined to 57.35 lakh hectares this season from 35.5 lakh hectares previously.
Agricultural economist Alam said the overall Aman rice output may be 1.55 crore tonnes to 1.60 crore tonnes this year.
""Farmers had to transplant the seedlings late because of floods. This may cause lower yields,"" he said while adding that imports might not be needed as stocks of the grains are favourable.
""But the next Boro rice crop is crucial,"" he said. ""We will not need to worry about food security of the staple grain if we can ensure production inputs, mainly fertiliser, at the doorsteps of farmers.""
Kabir said the ongoing flood in the Sherpur-Netrokona districts will damage the Aman crop in the fields and it cannot be recovered.
""So, whether we will need to import or not will depend on the next Aman harvest. And the output of the upcoming Boro would depend largely on the management of fertiliser by the government.""
""The interim government has to ensure proper management of fertiliser to ensure a good harvest of Boro rice,"" he added.

Bangladesh's economy is expected to grow 4 percent in the current fiscal year ending in June 2025, said the World Bank (WB) by revising its previous forecast on 'significant uncertainties around the political and economic outlook following the recent political turmoil.'
The Washington-based multilateral lender had earlier projected a 5.7 percent growth for FY 2024-25.
The WB also lowered its estimate for Bangladesh's economic growth in FY24 to 5.2 percent, notably lower than the government's provisional estimate of 5.82 percent for the previous fiscal year.
""The wide range of growth projections reflects the lack of reliable data in recent months, as well as the significant uncertainties surrounding the political and economic outlook following the recent political unrest,"" the WB said in its October 2024 South Asia Development Update released today.
These revised projections for FY24 and FY25 would mark the lowest growth rates since FY20 when Bangladesh's economy expanded by only 3.45 percent due to the Covid-19 pandemic's severe impact.
The WB's forecast is considerably lower than the 6.75 percent growth target set by the previous Awami League government for FY 2024-25.
""In the short term, political uncertainties are expected to suppress investment and industrial growth. Additionally, recent floods are likely to modestly affect agricultural production,"" the report added.
The WB also highlighted that an interim government took office after the resignation of the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 8, 2024, amid widespread student-led protests.
In the medium to long term, the WB expects growth to gradually recover, supported by key reforms in the financial sector, increased domestic resource mobilisation, an improved business climate, and expanded trade.
For FY 2025-26, the WB forecasts Bangladesh's economy to grow by 5.5 percent.
Bangladesh is one of two South Asian countries, along with the Maldives, for which the WB has downgraded growth projections.
This revision comes just two weeks after the Asian Development Bank (ADB) lowered its growth forecast for Bangladesh to 5.1 percent for the current fiscal year, citing supply chain disruptions caused by political unrest in July and August 2024.

Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) yesterday unveiled the export data for the July-September period of fiscal year 2024-25 and officially acknowledged that there was a $3.16 billion export data mismatch in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.
The bureau mentioned the National Board of Revenue's (NBR) role in the data mismatch, an awkward revelation which came to light in July this year and led to a three-month suspension of regular export data publication.
At a press conference, EPB officials announced the end of the data publication pause and said there would be no data gap between the revenue board and EPB in the future.
The bureau said that Bangladesh's exports grew 5 percent year-on-year to $11.37 billion in the July-September quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, driven by increased apparel shipments.
In September alone, exporters earned $3.5 billion, a 6.78 percent increase compared to the same month of the previous year, according to the corrected export figures for September 2023.
Regarding the data mistake, the EPB said the export earnings for July to September in FY2023-24 were reported at $13.98 billion, but it was actually $10.82 billion.
""We collect export data from the National Board of Revenue (NBR),"" said Md Anwar Hossain, vice-chairman of the EPB. ""As NBR made mistakes in data input, EPB's output was also incorrect.""
He said the revenue board counts exports after duty assessment, while the Bangladesh Bank counts exports when earnings are realised.
In July, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) published data showing that actual shipments for the July-April period of the 2023-24 fiscal year were nearly $14 billion lower than the export figures initially reported by the EPB.
The discrepancy between export figures has persisted for at least 12 years, with the gap surpassing $12 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year.
To estimate and correct the data mismatch in the July-September period of FY24, Hossain said the EPB held a series of meetings with the NBR and the central bank. They decided to consider export earnings only after shipment.
He added that they were planning to release live data connected to the NBR database but needed more time to do so.
Multiple entries the main culprit
Referring to the findings of the Bangladesh Bank inquiry into the data mismatch, Hossain said multiple entries of shipments by customs officials at the NBR were the main reason for the data discrepancy.
In the case of garment orders under the cutting, making and trimming (CMT) process, the EPB calculated the prices of fabrics and all accessories, instead of only the making charge. This was another contributing factor to inflated data.
He also said that sample items shipped abroad for buyers were counted as exports, assigning value to items with no actual export value.
Besides, sales by companies within Export Processing Zones (EPZs) were counted twice: once during delivery from the EPZs to local firms and again during shipment from the ports by foreign buyers.
Actual proceeds usually fall below the initial value mentioned in letters of credit (LC), a discrepancy that the EPB did not adjust, the Bangladesh Bank said in its probe report.
Losses stemming from stock-lot sales, discounts and commissions were also not adjusted by the EPB, according to the central bank.
The BB arrived at these findings through its inquiry into the reasons behind the increase in net trade credit, the gap between reported shipment values and actual money flow into Bangladesh.
Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez, president of the Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI), said the inflated export data from the EPB gave a negative impression to the general public, hinting that garment exporters were laundering money.
""But, this was due to incorrect data input by government entities.""
The erroneous statistics and its implications not only humiliated exporters but also provided misleading information to policymakers, causing them to believe that the readymade garments sector had built up capacity for incentive phase-out.
According to Parvez, the EPB was repeatedly warned about the inflated export data by apparel exporters, but to no avail.

business,Chinese electric car companies cope with European tariffs,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
MG Motor, BYD and other Chinese electric car manufacturers say they will maintain their low sticker prices in Europe even after being hit with hefty tariffs this month.
MG, the best-selling Chinese electric car brand in Europe, says it will guarantee its prices until the end of 2024, having stockpiled cars before the duties took effect.
MG, an historic British company that is now a subsidiary of Shanghai SAIC, now faces EU duties of 35.3 percent.
""Prices in the automobile market have soared in recent years, but our desire to offer technological, safe and low environmental footprint vehicles to French motorists is intact,"" Julien Robert, vice-president of MG Motor France, said in a statement Friday.
BYD, which faces duties of 17 percent, is opening hundreds of dealerships across Europe and is offering discounts on its sedans and SUVs.
Starting at the end of October, Chinese electric cars imported into Europe will be subject to tariffs as high as 45 percent.
The European Commission accuses Chinese manufacturers of receiving massive state subsidies and says the duties are necessary to create a level playing fields.
Tesla, which is being hit with duty of just 7.8 percent, initially raised prices on its Chinese-made Model 3 sedan before lowering them Tuesday.
Xpeng, which only offers high-end models in Europe, also told AFP it will not increase prices.
According to Sebastien Amichi, a consultant at Kearney, Chinese companies may be able to avoid jacking up prices for two to three years, especially if they receive help from the Chinese government.
Chinese car sales in Europe remain modest, about 300,000 in 2024 out of a market of 15 million vehicles, and therefore easy to subsidise, he said.
Meanwhile, MG, BYD and Chery plan to open factories in Hungary, Spain and Turkey to avoid the tariffs.
""There are European governments that have contacted me to ask if I could sell factories to Chinese companies,"" Carlos Tavares, director general of Stellantis (Peugeot, Fiat, Opel) said Thursday.
If the Chinese capture 10 percent of the European market, then ""mathematically there are seven or eight factories that would close or be transferred to the Chinese,"" he said while visiting a factory in the east of France.
Stellantis has started making small electric cars for its Chinese partner Leapmotor in a Fiat factory in Poland.
At the same time, German brands fear a severe backlash on their sales in China, which represent a significant part of their profits.
And the Chinese government has retaliated by imposing tariffs on other European sectors, such as brandy producers.

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment

Some garment work orders have shifted to competitor countries as a result of the recent spell of labour unrest in major apparel manufacturing belts across Bangladesh.
Renowned entrepreneur and garment exporter Tapan Chowdhury made the remark during a conversation with members of the Economic Reporters' Forum (ERF) at its office in Dhaka yesterday.
Chowdhury, chief executive officer of Square Group, said his company, which produces garment items for leading clothing brands, had seen a portion of work orders shift to other countries, especially Sri Lanka, as buyers want to avoid uncertainty and ensure smooth and timely supply of goods.
However, it is expected that these brands will return with a handful of work orders for his company and Bangladesh as a whole if stability and normalcy are restored.
Chowdhury, also managing director of Square Pharmaceuticals, said the law-and-order situation in major garment-producing areas is better now than it was during the initial days after the interim government was formed.
Replying to queries, he said Bangladesh's graduation from the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) should be postponed as the sudden erosion of the preferential trade benefits may present challenges for businesses.
He added that investors had delayed plans to set up industries in the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Industrial Park in Gazaria of Munshiganj as gas connections were yet to be provided.
He further said that Square Group plans to list more companies under the conglomerate on the stock markets if better opportunities arrive in the future, although he conceded they are now facing difficulties in managing their two listed companies.
""We are feeling very comfortable after a big change,"" he said regarding the political changeover and the business environment in the country.
""We are hopeful as the interim government's tenure is short and they want to bring a positive change. The advisers to the interim government are also saying that such an opportunity will not come again.""
During a recent visit to the US to attend the United Nations General Assembly, chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus asked major clothing brands to source more garment items from Bangladesh, Chowdhury said.
The Square Group CEO also voiced his support for the action being taken by the interim government against corrupt businessmen.
He recalled how he was involved in the family business with his father, where he learned not just to manage day-to-day operations, but also the importance of values and ethics in running businesses.
Chowdhury also mentioned a few instances of how some leading pharmaceutical companies failed to survive due to their tendency to dodge taxes.
He said it was very unfortunate that the reforms adopted by the previous caretaker government were not continued by the immediate past government.
""I want to believe change will come. I hope the interim government will be successful. The political leaders should also know that power does not exist forever.""
Although the textile and garment sectors are the biggest and most successful sectors in terms of contribution to the economy, employment generation and women empowerment, they have been facing some challenges due to labour unrest.
However, Chowdhury said the employees of Square are considered family members and this is the main strength of the company's values.
The workers, especially female workers, also have a huge contribution to the sector's success, he said.
""They spend their primes working in the garment sector and then contribute to their families, but it does not affect their productivity,"" he said, adding that female garment workers in Bangladesh are extremely disciplined.
""We want stability in the country. The decision of who will run the country will come through a vote,"" he added.
Large industries are investing in the heavy industrial sector and if the opportunity presents itself, Square Group also has plans to invest in large and heavy industries.
Since the county does not have a petrochemical industry, there is a lack of APIs.
Chowdhury added that the price of medicine is fixed through stringent consultation among regulators. As the drug administration monitors the process, companies cannot fix prices at will.
However, he said prices of oncology medicines are higher as most are imported.

The German government on Wednesday slashed its 2024 forecast for Europe's largest economy, saying it will contract for a second straight year before a recovery gets under way in 2025.
Output is expected to shrink by 0.2 percent in 2024, the economy ministry said in a statement, a sharp downgrade from the 0.3-percent expansion previously forecast.
Germany's economy stalled in the first half of the year and a slew of disappointing indicators recently suggest ""the economic weakness will persist into the second half of the year"", it said.
Germany was already the only major advanced economy to fall into recession last year when it contracted by 0.3 percent, acting as a drag on the wider eurozone.
Stubbornly weak domestic and foreign demand, high interest rates and costly energy in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine have all weighed heavily on the German economy -- particularly its crucial manufacturing sector.
At the same time, the country faces structural challenges including an ageing population, increased competition from China, burdensome bureaucracy and a complex green transition.
""Germany's structural problems are now taking their toll,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck said.
""And this is happening amid major geo-economic challenges. Germany and Europe are caught in the middle of crises between China and the United States and must learn to assert themselves,"" he added.
Germany's woes were highlighted by a spate of bad news from the country's carmakers recently, as the flagship industry struggles with rising production costs and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers on electric vehicles.
Volkswagen, Europe's biggest auto manufacturer, last month cut its annual outlook and said it would for the first time have to consider closing factories in Germany.
Rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also lowered their outlook, citing falling Chinese demand.
Habeck warned that a Donald Trump victory in next month's US presidential election could worsen the problems for the German auto industry.
Trump has said he plans to levy tariffs on all foreign imports, including cars.
""We will then face ever greater problems, so you have to see that with great concern,"" said Habeck.
The economy ministry nevertheless expressed confidence that a rebound was just around the corner.
Higher wages, easing inflation and lower interest rates are expected to encourage domestic consumption next year, the ministry said, while an improved global outlook should boost exports and industrial investments.
The economy is expected to grow by 1.1 percent in 2025, according to the latest forecasts, up from a previous estimate of one percent.
In 2026, output is predicted to expand by 1.6 percent.
Habeck said the government's proposed ""growth initiative"" had a key role to play in the anticipated economic revival.
The measures include tax breaks for companies making investments, reduced energy prices for industry, less red tape and incentives to keep older people in the workforce as well as to attract foreign skilled workers.
""The economy will grow more strongly,"" Habeck said, if the measures are ""fully implemented"".
Business associations have warned that the measures would not be enough.
The growth package is welcome ""but nowhere near enough to truly get Germany back on track economically"", Peter Adrian, president of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK), told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
Wednesday's bleak forecast spurred new calls for a relaxation of the ""debt brake"", constitutionally enshrined rules that cap annual levels of borrowing, to spur much-needed new investments.
The government should ""declare an emergency and suspend the debt brake"", Achim Truger, an economist who is a member of a panel that advises the government, told broadcaster NTV.
With the economy facing such a ""dramatic"" situation, ""you can justify spending a lot of money again"", he added.

business,China opens $71 bn 'swap facility' to boost markets,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts
Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
China's central bank boosted support for markets Thursday by opening up tens of billions of dollars in liquidity for firms to buy stocks as part of a raft of measures by Beijing to kickstart the country's flagging economy.
Authorities last month unveiled several stimulus policies -- from interest rate cuts to relaxing home-buying rules -- after struggling since the end of Covid restrictions to reignite growth and get business activity back on track.
The news lit a fire under mainland and Hong Kong equities on renewed hopes that officials would finally get a grip on the issues that have dogged the economy for years, particularly a property debt crisis and tepid consumer spending.
That euphoria was dampened Tuesday as a much-anticipated news conference ended with just a pledge to meet the country's annual growth target but no more measures and no detail on those already announced.
But on Thursday the central bank fleshed out plans to encourage ""the healthy and stable development of the capital market"" by opening up a ""swap facility"" worth 500 billion yuan ($70.6 billion) that will allow firms to access cash to buy stocks.
Companies will be allowed to use equities, bonds and other assets as collateral for ""high-grade liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills"", it said.
The programme may be ""further expanded depending on the situation"", it added.
Shanghai shares rose more than one percent in early trade and Hong Kong added more than two percent.
The measures were first announced last month alongside a raft of stimulus measures that triggered a blistering rally that sent markets up more than 20 percent.
People's Bank of China (PBoC) chief Pan Gongsheng said at the time the plans would ""significantly enhance"" firms' ability to access funds to buy stocks.
Beijing also last month slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages.
China faces multiple issues including a prolonged crisis in the property sector, chronically low consumption, high unemployment among young people, and elevated local government debt.
In a bid to shore up the housing market -- once a key driver of growth -- several major cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen have also eased restrictions on buying homes.
Analysts say more direct state support is needed to boost consumption and achieve the government's official national growth target of about five percent for this year.
Top economic planner Zheng Shanjie this week said Beijing was ""fully confident"" that it would hit that goal.
""We are also fully confident in maintaining stable, healthy and sustainable development,"" he added.
An analyst told AFP the central bank had been ""doing much of the heavy lifting in the latest wave of stimulus"".
""The PBoC recognises the urgency needed to address the economic issues in China,"" Heron Lim, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said.
""But the PBoC actions are only one part of the equation in boosting sentiment,"" he said. ""What is required now is the action plan for fiscal support to come through.""
Traders are hoping that plan comes on Saturday, when Finance Minister Lan Fo'an is set to hold a briefing on fiscal policy in Beijing.
China's State Council said Lan will outline ""countercyclical adjustment of fiscal policy to promote high-quality economic development"".

Oil prices rose on Thursday underpinned by a spike in fuel demand as a major storm barreled into Florida and concerns about potential supply disruptions in the Middle East amid heightened tensions between Israel and major oil producer Iran.
Brent crude futures rose 63 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $77.21 a barrel, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 63 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $73.87 a barrel at 0423 GMT.
The world's largest oil producer and consumer has been hit by a second major storm, Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida's west coast, spawning tornadoes and threatening surges of seawater.
The storm has already driven up demand for gasoline in the state, with about a quarter of fuel stations selling out of supplies, which has helped support crude prices.
Further underpinning prices, investors remained wary of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant promising an Israeli strike against Iran would be ""lethal, precise and surprising"".
US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Israel's plans concerning Iran in a 30-minute call on Wednesday that the White House described as ""direct and very productive"".
Biden ""continues to discourage Israel from targeting oil facilities, but there is growing concern that Israel's allies have little influence on its strategy,"" analysts at ANZ said in a note on Thursday.
Even with threats to the oil-producing Middle Eastern region top of mind, concerns about demand continue to underpin the fundamental outlook. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Tuesday downgraded its demand forecast for 2025 on weakening economic activity in China and North America.
EIA data on Wednesday showed crude inventories jumped by 5.8 million barrels to 422.7 million barrels last week. That was a bigger build than analysts polled by Reuters had expected, but much lower than estimated on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute industry group.
However, oil demand has grown this month, according to analysts at JPMorgan, helping support prices.
""In the US, gasoline demand surged by 800 kbd week over week.. Across Asia, flight activity rebounded after being disrupted by multiple typhoons. In China, daily flight activity soared to an eight-week high,"" the analysts said in a note.
""With the majority of travel-related demand now behind us, the focus shifts to the impending weather-driven rise in demand in the coming weeks.""

The National Board of Revenue (NBR) yesterday reduced the duty on sugar imports from 30 percent to 15 percent to bring down prices of the sweetener in the local market.
As a result of this reduction, the import cost of raw sugar will decrease by Tk 11.18 per kilogramme (kg) and the cost of refined sugar will drop by Tk 14.26 per kg, according to a statement issued by the NBR.
At retail, the prices have increased by 2 percent in Dhaka over the past month and is now ranging from Tk 125 to Tk 135 per kilogramme, according to data from state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
The NBR expects the duty cut to decrease market prices and discourage smuggling.
Industry insiders believe so too.
As a result of this reduction, the import cost of raw sugar will decrease by Tk 11.18 per kg""Definitely, this move will help reduce the existing prices as well as smuggling,"" said Taslim Shahriar, deputy general manager of the Meghna Group of Industries, one of the leading importers and processors of commodities.But a decrease in the price might come about gradually once existing stocks get sold, he said.The tax administration took the decision after the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC) proposed doing so for both the unrefined and refined varieties and to increase surveillance in border areas to stop illegal importsThis will help keep prices stable during the holy month of Ramadan, which is around five months away and when demand usually increases, the BTTC said.Bangladesh annually requires 24 lakh tonnes of sugar and five refiners meet around 99 percent of the total requirement by importing raw sugar mainly from Brazil, according to industry insiders.State sugar mills meet just 1 percent of the demand.Bangladesh's sugar imports fell sharply in fiscal year 2023-24 as refiners stayed away from placing orders with foreign buyers, alleging there was an illegal influx of the sweetener through the borders.Import of raw sugar by the refiners stood at 13.86 lakh tonnes last fiscal year whereas it was 18.49 lakh tonnes in the preceding year, according to data compiled by the commerce ministry.

Summit Group yesterday urged the interim government to withdraw its recent decision to terminate an agreement over the establishment of the group's second floating regasification plant for liquified natural gas (LNG) imported by Bangladesh.
Summit LNG Terminal II Co (SLNG II), a unit of Summit Group, did not breach any conditions precedent of agreements signed with Petrobangla to build the ""Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU)"", said a Summit press release.
A condition precedent is an event that must come to pass before a specific contract is considered to be in effect, according to investopedia.com.
SLNG II said they received a notice from Petrobangla on October 7 notifying of the termination of the project situated at Moheshkhali in Cox's Bazar.
They said the notice mentioned that SLNG II did not submit a ""performance bond"" by June 28 or within the stipulated 90 days as per prior agreements.
A performance bond is a bond issued by a bank or other financial institution guaranteeing the fulfilment of a particular contract.
Summit, Petrobangla and Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company had finalised a ""Terminal Use Agreement"" and ""Implementation Agreement"", it said.
The two documents were vetted and approved by the cabinet committee and signed on March 30 this year, said the statement.
""But the date (June 28) fell on a Friday (not a banking day in Bangladesh), the performance bond was delivered on the next possible working day, with acknowledgement by Petrobangla,"" said SLNG II.
""Our lawyers have confirmed that SLNG II had not breached any CPs (conditions precedent) of the agreements,"" it said.
""Even if any CP was delayed, Petrobangla did not notify SLNG II (about it) within the agreed 30-day window and had therefore deemed the CP as accepted,"" it added.
Summit Group is the largest private sector investor in Bangladesh's energy sector with a proven track record of developing long-term infrastructure projects, said SLNG II.
It urged the government to uphold the sanctity of contracts and to ensure that investors' rights are protected and treated fairly and equitably.
The statement said the last government took a strategic decision to make a transition from coal-fired power generation to natural gas, a cleaner energy source, in late 2020.
Following the decision, Summit Group submitted a proposal October 11, 2021 to implement an FSRU on a ""Build, Own, Operate, and Transfer"" (BOOT) basis, it said.
The proposal was approved on June 14, 2023, followed by two years of extensive negotiations and consultations with international law firms to address the contractual and technical challenges, it added.
In addition, a long-term ""Sale and Purchase Agreement"" was signed to supply 1.5 million tonnes of LNG per year, starting in October 2026.
""To fulfil the initial conditions precedent of the agreements, SLNG II has committed to invest approximately $15 million to implement the country's third FSRU,"" reads the press release.

business,The egg price dilemma and public health,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts
Accolade for business icons
Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Article 18:1 of the constitution of Bangladesh articulates that the state will consider the development of nutritional levels and improvement of public health in the country as a primary duty.
But despite making significant progress in upgrading the nutritional status of its population, malnutrition remains a key concern for Bangladesh.
According to a study, around 6 lakh children are suffering from severe malnutrition. The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 revealed that 24 percent of the children aged under 5 are stunted while 22 percent are underweight, and 11 percent are wasted.
Also, almost half of the women in the country are suffering from anaemia mainly due to malnutrition.
One of the critical reasons for malnutrition is protein deficiency. Due to exorbitant prices, almost two-thirds of our population can hardly afford to consume meat, fish or milk, which are the main sources of improved protein.
The only affordable source of protein available for common people used to be eggs. However, the way egg prices have skyrocketed, it has gone beyond the reach of the people with lower income.
And although the authority has implemented a number of measures, like fixing egg prices and importing them from India, the price of egg only seems to be shooting up further.
We need to really go underneath the challenges to find a win-win solution for all the stakeholders –producers, traders and off course, consumers. Quite often we hear, compared to India and Pakistan, our egg price is almost 85 percent higher. Why so? The production cost of egg in Bangladesh as opposed to our neighbouring countries is also significantly higher.
The main cost element of egg production is the poultry feed, which contributes to almost 65-70 percent of the total cost. The cost of poultry feed in Bangladesh is almost 50 percent higher compared to that of India and Pakistan. Major ingredients for poultry feed are corn and soyabean, which are mostly imported to Bangladesh whereas India and Pakistan meet their demand with domestic production.
The cost of layer chickens is also higher in Bangladesh; sometimes nearly double as opposed to our neighbours.
Now the question comes: how can we minimise our egg production cost? Firstly, we need to ensure the importers, who supply corn and soybean, charge fair prices. Here comes monitoring from the authority. To reduce our dependency on import, we need to maximise the local production of both crops. We also need to find a way to minimise the cost of chicks.
Also, the government could consider supplying eggs at a subsidised rate to lower income groups.
If we look at the total egg supply chain landscape, 30 percent is supplied by large corporates and the rest is controlled by the stockists/Arotdars. So, the concerned authority should have a mechanism in place to make sure there is no manipulation being done here.
Importing eggs from India could be counterproductive as it may jeopardise the local poultry industry. Approximately 2.5 million workers are directly employed in poultry sector and, so far, investment in this industry is about Tk 35,000 crore.
This industry needs to be nurtured with the utmost priority and proper planning so that our people get enough protein at an affordable price and thus, we build a healthier nation.

The interim government of Bangladesh is going to purchase another 33,000 tonnes of liquified natural gas (LNG) for Tk 657 crore from the spot market.
The advisory committee on government purchases yesterday approved the LNG import, with Singapore-based MS Gunvor Singapore Pte set to supply the fuel at $13.93 for each million British thermal unit.
The government already bought two consignments of LNG early this month, with MS Gunvor Singapore Pte set to supply those as well for $13.57 and $13.77 per million British thermal unit.
The interim government also yesterday decided to buy 10,000 tonnes of lentil at a cost of about Tk 96 per kilogramme.
Additionally, the committee approved the purchase of 60,000 tonnes of Urea fertiliser and 30,000 tonnes TSP fertiliser. Of the 60,000 tonnes, 30,000 tonnes will cost $343 per tonne while the remainder will cost $356 per tonne for having separate sourcing destinations.
Meanwhile, the 30,000 tonnes of TSP fertiliser will be imported from Morocco at $415 per tonne.
Following the advisory council meeting, Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters that inflation is complex and does not increase suddenly.
""There are many reasons for the inflation,"" he said while informing that although the interim government is trying to tame commodity prices, it will need more time to achieve this goal.
Against this backdrop, Ahmed urged the country's people to be patient given the current situation.
And although there are now fewer extortionists in the market, the prevalence of middlemen has not fallen yet,"" he added.

business,Bangladesh's rice output crosses 4cr tonnes for the first time,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

For the first time, Bangladesh has bagged more than 4 crore tonnes of rice in a fiscal year (FY) thanks to increasing yields of the most grown crop, according to official data.
Local farmers have been gradually switching to high-yielding and hybrid varieties of the cereal grain, bringing the country's need for rice imports down to zero.
Estimates by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) show that farmers bagged 4.10 crore tonnes of rice in FY 2023-24, up by 4.1 percent year-on-year in what was the highest growth in six years.
The largest growth in yields came from Aman paddy, which was harvested in the previous winter ahead of Boro paddy in the dry season. Boro is the principal rice crop in Bangladesh.
Farmers got about 2.10 crore tonnes of rice through the Boro harvest in the May-June period early this calendar year.
FY24 marked the fifth year of a consistent rise in rice production with Wais Kabir, a former executive chairman of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council, linking the spike to yield enhancement.
""One of the main factors is that farmers have shifted to cultivating modern varieties of rice. They are growing more high-yielding and hybrid varieties. The acreage has also risen over time,"" he said.
Jahangir Alam, an agricultural economist, said increased rice production cut import of the cereal grain.
""We did not have to import any rice [in FY24]. Besides, this did not have much of an impact on prices as it seems public and private stocks were adequate,"" Kabir added.
Data of the food ministry shows that Bangladesh imported 10.56 lakh tonnes of rice in FY23 compared to zero public and private imports as of October 7 this year.
Kabir also said one of the reasons behind the zero rice imports was a surge in wheat imports.
The use of wheat by bakery and food processing industriesas well as animal feed has increased. This contributed to the reduced requirement for rice, he added.
Imports of wheat, the second most consumed cereal grain after rice, soared 71 percent year-on-year to 66 lakh tonnes in FY24.
M Asaduzzman, a professorial fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies expressed doubt over the rice production estimate.
He questioned why prices have gone up if supply was indeed adequate.
""Production has not risen as much as reported. Higher prices mean there is a supply shortage,"" he said, adding that rice accounts for a good portion of food inflation, which was high in the previous fiscal.
The BBS said food inflation rose to 10.65 percent in FY24 from 8.71 percent the year prior.
The price of rice coarse rice, the cheapest variety, was 7 percent higher year-on-year at Tk 50 to Tk 55 per kilogramme in Dhaka yesterday.
Asaduzzman informed that recurrent floods this year have raised concerns over the cultivation of Aman.
""We will have to import rice if Aman production suffers. And that will be clear at the beginning of November. So, the government should take a decision regarding imports next month,"" he said.
By the end of August, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said Aus and Aman rice acreage and production in Bangladesh might decline because of the floods, particularly the devastating deluge in the eastern part of the country.
Estimates by the Department of Agricultural Extension show that Aman acreage declined to 57.35 lakh hectares this season from 35.5 lakh hectares previously.
Agricultural economist Alam said the overall Aman rice output may be 1.55 crore tonnes to 1.60 crore tonnes this year.
""Farmers had to transplant the seedlings late because of floods. This may cause lower yields,"" he said while adding that imports might not be needed as stocks of the grains are favourable.
""But the next Boro rice crop is crucial,"" he said. ""We will not need to worry about food security of the staple grain if we can ensure production inputs, mainly fertiliser, at the doorsteps of farmers.""
Kabir said the ongoing flood in the Sherpur-Netrokona districts will damage the Aman crop in the fields and it cannot be recovered.
""So, whether we will need to import or not will depend on the next Aman harvest. And the output of the upcoming Boro would depend largely on the management of fertiliser by the government.""
""The interim government has to ensure proper management of fertiliser to ensure a good harvest of Boro rice,"" he added.

business,Some garment work orders shifted to other countries for labour unrest,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Some garment work orders have shifted to competitor countries as a result of the recent month-long spell of labour unrest in major apparel manufacturing belts across Bangladesh.
Renowned entrepreneur and garment exporter Tapan Chowdhury, chief executive officer of Square Group, made the remark during a conversation with members of the Economic Reporters' Forum (ERF) at its office in Dhaka today.
Chowdhury said his company, which produces garment items for leading clothing brands, had seen a portion of work orders shift to other countries, especially Sri Lanka, as buyers want to avoid uncertainty and ensure smooth and timely supply of goods.
However, it is expected that these brands will return with a handful of work orders for his company and Bangladesh as a whole if stability and normalcy are restored.
Chowdhury, also managing director of Square Pharmaceuticals, said the law-and-order situation in major garment-producing areas is better now than it was during the initial days after the interim government was formed.
Replying to queries, he said Bangladesh's graduation from the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) should be postponed as the sudden erosion of the preferential trade benefits may present challenges for businesses.
He added that investors had delayed plans to set up industries in the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Industrial Park in Gazaria of Munshiganj as gas connections were yet to be provided.
He further said that Square Group plans to list more companies under the conglomerate on the stock markets if better opportunities arrive in the future, although he conceded they are now facing difficulties in managing their two listed companies.
""We are feeling very comfortable after a big change,"" he said regarding the political changeover and the business environment in the country.
""We are hopeful as the interim government's tenure is short and they want to bring a positive change. The advisers to the interim government are also saying that such an opportunity will not come again.""
During a recent visit to the US to attend the United Nations General Assembly, chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus asked major clothing brands to source more garment items from Bangladesh, Chowdhury said.
The Square Group CEO also voiced his support for the action being taken by the interim government against corrupt businessmen.
He recalled how he was involved in the family business with his father, where he learned not just to manage day-to-day operations, but also the importance of values and ethics in running businesses.
Chowdhury also mentioned a few instances of how some leading pharmaceutical companies failed to survive due to their tendency to dodge taxes.
He said it was very unfortunate that the reforms adopted by the previous caretaker government were not continued by the immediate past government.
""I want to believe change will come. I hope the interim government will be successful. The political leaders should also know that power does not exist forever.""
Although the textile and garment sectors are the biggest and most successful sectors in terms of contribution to the economy, employment generation and women empowerment, they have been facing some challenges due to labour unrest.
However, Chowdhury said the employees of Square are considered family members and this is the main strength of the company's values.
The workers, especially female workers, also have a huge contribution to the sector's success, he said.
""They spend their primes working in the garment sector and then contribute to their families, but it does not affect their productivity,"" he said, adding that female garment workers in Bangladesh are extremely disciplined.
""We want stability in the country. The decision of who will run the country will come through a vote,"" he added.
Large industries are investing in the heavy industrial sector and if the opportunity presents itself, Square Group also has plans to invest in large and heavy industries.
Since the county does not have a petrochemical industry, there is a lack of APIs.
Chowdhury added that the price of medicine is fixed through stringent consultation among regulators. As the drug administration monitors the process, companies cannot fix prices at will.
However, he said prices of oncology medicines are higher as most are imported.

business,Merchant marine officers’ body demands overall reform in maritime sector,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
The country's maritime sector was plagued by extreme level of corruption and irregularities during the last regime and the situation is still unchanged, according to the leaders of Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association (BMMOA).
The Awami League regime posted unfit persons on deputation in many of the key administrative posts in related organisations like the Department of Shipping, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) and marine institutes, depriving marine professionals, they said.
They demanded overall reform in the marine sector and an immediate end to the existing discriminatory administrative management.
The association made the calls at a press conference at the BMMOA office in Chattogram today.
At the event, BMMOA President Captain Md Anam Chowdhury placed five-point demands, including appointment of marine professionals in key regulatory and academic posts in maritime and shipping organisations and training institutes.
Due to the presence of incompetent officials at the policy level, several unfeasible projects like Payra Port and Bay Terminal project in Chattogram were taken during previous regime, he said.
He alleged that the incumbent director general of shipping, Commodore Mohammad Maksud Alam, wrote to the shipping ministry on July 4 for temporary appointment in some 50 vacant posts, including chief nautical surveyor, chief engineering surveyor, nautical surveyor and deputy nautical surveyor in the shipping department on deputation with officials from government organisations like Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Coast Guard, Civil Aviation, who are not qualified in seafarer professions.
""These are the completely technical posts while the post holders need to have marine professional qualifications as they have to implement more than 50 IMO conventions,"" said Captain Anam, who demanded the DG's resignation.
Moreover, the incumbent Commandant of Barishal Marine Academy, a Navy official posted there on deputation, recently argued for appointing Navy captains as commandants in all marine academies, saying merchant mariners as less competent, the BMMOA president said.
Captain Anam said this is a gross violation of the IMO STCW convention that made it mandatory that the instructors, supervisors and assessors of seafarers need to be qualified in the particular field.
BMMOA General Secretary Marine Engineer Md Shakawat Hossain and Senior Member Captain Atique Ua Khan also spoke at the conference among others.

Cooling inflation, low unemployment, robust economic growth and... downbeat voters.
Despite indicators showing the US economy is moving in a healthy direction, many Americans remain pessimistic about business and job prospects -- a mood that poses a frustrating problem for Vice President Kamala Harris in her neck-and-neck race with Donald Trump for the White House.
Less than a month before November's presidential election, the US economy added around 100,000 more jobs than expected in September, saw wages grow further and inflation approach striking distance of policymakers' two percent target.
Yet, almost half the respondents of a New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday rated current economic conditions ""poor.""
Poll after poll has also found the economy -- particularly inflation -- to be a top voter concern by far.
While Harris has narrowed Trump's lead, polls have suggested voters favor the former president on economic issues.
Economists point to a cumulative rise in costs since the pandemic, still-high home prices and uneven job gains in explaining a seeming disconnect between data and voter sentiment.
""At the same time that they're aware that inflation has slowed, (consumers) remain frustrated by high prices,"" said Joanne Hsu of the University of Michigan.
For politicians, ""the low-hanging fruit is trying to take aim at prices that people see on a day-to-day basis,"" economist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics said, referring to food and gas.
""This election cycle just highlights inflation is extremely unpopular,"" he added.
""Over the last few years, consumers have gone through a period of very large price increases,"" Sweet told AFP.
""You'd have to go back to the 1970s and 1980s to see the last time that the US economy had inflation that high.""
Inflation climbed to over 14 percent in 1980. Consumers again saw price increases soar to a painful 9.1 percent in mid-2022.
""For many voters, that's the first time they experienced (such) inflation,"" Sweet said.
While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 2.5 percent in August, Sweet said ""it's the price level that matters to the consumer"" and not inflation numbers.
The CPI for food has risen 26 percent since February 2020 during the pandemic, he noted. The cost of gas also increased, while that of new and used vehicles are around 20 percent above 2020 levels.
Trump appears to be tapping into such sentiment.
""Inflation has devastated our economy,"" he told reporters last week. Trump also linked last week's dockworkers strike to inflation, saying it badly hit workers.
On Sunday, he charged that ""inflation will soar"" if Harris took office and promised to ""make America affordable again.""
""Just seeing prices increase steadily over time weighs on the collective psyche, particularly for low-, mid-income households,"" said Sweet.
Voters' gloominess come despite the Congressional Budget Office finding in May that purchasing power grew across groups as incomes rose quicker than prices between 2019 and 2023.
It may be true that wages are rising faster than inflation in general, Hsu said, ""but that's not necessarily true for an individual person.""
And it's hard to shake off memories of the pandemic, said Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic.
""Those years where income fell short, household income, consumers relied more on credit cards or dipped more into their savings,"" added Bostjancic.
This means higher credit card bills and more delinquencies, especially among lower-income or younger people, adding to pressures like student loans, she added.
The pre-pandemic savings rate was over seven percent but currently stands at around five percent.
Overall hiring numbers also mask large variations across industries, said ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak.
Job growth has been concentrated in a few industries, with basically all jobs added recently going towards sectors that ""only account for 48 percent of employment,"" she added.
The other half of US workers have seen ""unusually slow growth in their industries,"" Pollak said, with hiring sluggish outside sectors like government, health care, and leisure and hospitality.
Although workers had 17 months of positive real wage growth, they experienced a longer period of negative growth previously.
""There are many workers who still feel like their wages need to catch up,"" she said.

business,Neither precedent nor Trump can save Big Tech,"Interim govt struggling on many fronts

Death of Renu in mob beating: 1 sentenced to death, 4 life imprisonment
Banks asked to freeze accounts of Abul Hasanat Abdullah, family members
Alphabet, parent of search colossus Google, has suffered the latest setback in a long line of legal challenges. After losing a jury trial against game store Epic Games in December, a judge has now ruled that Google must open a key piece of its Android smartphone operating system. Add to that an imminent squeeze from the Department of Justice, and it's a reminder of how many blows the industry has received under US President Joe Biden. Those hoping for a reprieve if Donald Trump wins back the presidency in November should think twice, though – what's happening goes far beyond the White House.
The injunction issued Monday orders Google to cease various restrictive agreements that effectively neuter third-party app stores on Android. For three years, the search giant must allow rival stores to be downloaded through its own system and provide users access to this catalog. This follows a jury trial won by Epic, which chafed against the steep cut taken by both Google and iPhone maker Apple of all transactions on their phones. Google says it will appeal.
It's hugely consequential. Alphabet hives off as much as 30 percent of the revenue from makers like Epic. And by 2019, the Google Play app store already accounted for $7 billion of the company's operating income, or a fifth of the total, according to court filings. That tax angers plenty of peers that depend on reaching smartphone users.
In practice, user habits may not change all at once. Still, difficulties for Alphabet will keep coming. A case won against Google's control of search is awaiting a follow-up trial over what remedies the government will demand. The DOJ's request, expected Tuesday, could range from nixing revenue-share agreements to a full-blown breakup.
The tech-hostile agenda of President Biden's antitrust enforcers, Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, has drawn much gnashing of teeth: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffmann, a Democratic donor, called for Khan to be fired. The list of lawsuits and blocked mergers has hit everyone from Microsoft to Facebook parent Meta Platforms.
A change of administration would matter: merger review could soften; when the Bush administration took over in the middle of the early 2000s case against Microsoft, the push to split it apart ended. But there are much bigger forces pushing against Google and Apple.
That doesn't just mean laws seeking to open app stores in South Korea, Japan or the European Union, though that's all happening. Nor does it end at private lawsuits like Epic's. Smaller tech firms might find themselves gunning for larger ones too. Meta recently unveiled its augmented-reality headset, Orion, following on from similar glasses from social media firm Snap. Their success likely depends on being able to work freely with currently locked-down smartphones.
Venture capitalists and various tech bigwigs might want to personalize this as a fight between innovators on the one side and Khan and Kanter on the other. The truth is, as the DOJ case against Apple effectively framed it, new platforms right now are struggling to be born. Doing so requires pushing aside the restrictions of the old ones for good. That train is going to be hard to stop.
Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Oct. 7 issued an injunction forcing search engine and smartphone operating system giant Google to make several changes to its app store policies.
Under the ruling, which results from a jury trial won by videogame platform Epic Games in December, Google for three years must refrain from various revenue sharing and restrictive partnership agreements preventing the distribution of third-party app stores. In addition, Google must allow alternative app stores to access its catalog of apps, and must allow the download of competing stores through its own.

China's finance minister will hold a briefing this weekend focused on fiscal policy, authorities said Wednesday, as investors seek further action after a recent slew of measures aimed at reversing an economic slump.
The news comes after traders on the mainland and in Hong Kong were left disappointed by a news conference Tuesday in which officials failed to unveil any new stimulus and provided scant detail on its plans for implementing the raft measures already flagged.
Lan Fo'an will use Saturday's news conference to outline ""countercyclical adjustment of fiscal policy to promote high-quality economic development"", Beijing announced.
The world's second-largest economy has struggled to regain its footing since the lifting of pandemic measures at the end of 2022.
Economists say more direct state support is needed to boost flagging consumption and achieve the government's official national growth target of about five percent for this year.
Beijing last month announced over several days its most aggressive stimulus in years, including key interest rate cuts and the easing of restrictions on homebuying.
An anticipated event Tuesday led by the head of China's National Development and Reform Commission dashed investor hopes for more measures, with Commission head Zheng Shanjie saying only that the government was ""fully confident"" of hitting its growth target.
""It is likely that they first want to see what the effect is of the previous stimulus before adding new stimulus measures,"" Teeuwe Mevissen, senior China economist at Rabobank, told AFP.
""It is well known that (President Xi Jinping) is not a big fan of generous social security and/or fiscal stimulus to increase private demand,"" he said.
""So if fiscal stimulus for the demand side of the economy is not strictly necessary then they will likely refrain from it.""

India's central bank held interest rates steady on Wednesday but left the door open for future cuts, as growth moderates in the world's fifth largest economy.
The Reserve Bank of India said the benchmark repo rate -- the short-term interest paid by the central bank on loans from commercial lenders -- will stay unchanged at 6.50 percent for the tenth meeting in a row.
Central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said the bank would remain ""unambiguously focused"" on aligning inflation with its target while still supporting growth.
""It is with a lot of effort that the inflation horse has been brought to the stable,"" he said.
""We have to be very careful about opening the gate as the horse may simply bolt again.""
Major central banks around the world have kicked off a global easing cycle in response to lower inflation -- including the US Federal Reserve, which last month brought down rates for the first time in over four years.
India's retail inflation came in at 3.65 percent in August, slightly higher than the 3.54 percent recorded in July, with both figures below the central bank's four percent target.
Analysts believe ongoing conflict in the Middle East could pose future upside risks.
The RBI's monetary policy committee did however announce a shift in its policy stance to ""neutral"" from its earlier hawkish position, laying the ground for rate cuts in future.
The central bank's decision comes after early signs of slowing economic growth.
India's growth came in at 6.7 percent in the March-June quarter, on the back of lower government spending and some economic indicators showing muted urban consumer sentiment.
While the data still placed India among the world's fastest-growing major economies, it was the slowest pace of growth in five quarters and lower than the central bank's estimate of 7.1 percent.
The International Monetary forecasts 7 percent growth in India for the 2024-25 fiscal year.
The RBI hiked rates by 2.5 percentage points between May 2022 and February 2023 and has left them unchanged since.

Oil prices steadied in Asian trading on Wednesday as traders weighed developments in the Middle East conflict against continued bearish expectations for demand.
Brent crude futures rose 22 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $77.4 a barrel by 0349 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate futures rose 14 cents to $73.71 a barrel.
Prices had plunged more than 4 percent in the previous session on a possible Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire, but markets remain wary of a potential Israeli attack on Iran's oil infrastructure.
""The everyday dilemma of 'Middle Eastern headlines' moving like a pendulum between 'ceasefire talks' and 'further escalation in attacks' has been distracting investors from reality ... Oil markets are twirled in sentiments of 'buying the rumor' and sidelining the real fundamentals that should matter,"" said Phillip Nova senior market analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in an email.
The sell-off on Tuesday followed a rally that began after Iran launched a missile barrage at Israel on Oct. 1, culminating in an 8% gain on the week on Friday, the largest in over a year.
Hezbollah officials on Tuesday appeared to back off from a truce in Gaza as a condition for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said he backed attempts to secure a truce in a televised speech, the first time the end of the war in Gaza was not mentioned as a pre-condition.
On the demand front, data showed US crude oil stocks rose by nearly 11 million barrels last week, much more than analysts polled by Reuters had expected, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. However, fuel stockpiles fell.
Weak demand continued to underpin the fundamental outlook. The US EIA on Tuesday downgraded its 2024 forecast for global oil demand growth by 20,000 barrels per day (bpd), to 103.1 million bpd, because of weaker industrial production and manufacturing growth in the US and China.
Concerns about a lack of further stimulus measures by Beijing to boost China's economy also capped oil market gains. Officials offered few new details at a press conference on Tuesday.
""China has a part to play as well, with a lack of new stimulus bringing some disappointment. Many market participants were hoping that its fiscal policies will follow in the footstep of the financial 'bazooka' delivered in late-September, but there was clearly a step-down in yesterday's announcement,"" said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong.

The United States and China on Tuesday raised concerns about trade between the world's two biggest economies, with China's commerce minister urging Washington to lift sanctions on his country's firms ""as soon as possible"".
Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao's call with US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was described by Beijing as ""candid, in-depth and pragmatic"".
It comes shortly after sharp US tariff hikes on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries and solar cells took effect -- with levies down the line on other products also recently finalised.
In addition, the United States is planning to ban the sale of connected vehicles incorporating Chinese and Russian technology, citing national security risks.
Washington has also restricted technology exports to China such as semiconductors and the machinery used to manufacture them.
On Tuesday, Wang ""focused on expressing serious concerns about US semiconductor policy on China and its restrictions on China's network-connected cars,"" said a statement from Beijing's commerce ministry.
Wang ""stressed that it is particularly necessary to clarify national security boundaries in economic and trade fields"".
That would allow for ""maintaining the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains"", the ministry said.
But a separate statement released by the US Commerce Department said Raimondo had reiterated that US national security is ""not negotiable"".
She pointed to the US government's approach of being targeted with security policy ""while leaving space for healthy trade and investment"", the statement said.
Raimondo flagged ongoing concerns as well from US businesses about China's ""decreasing regulatory transparency"", non-market policies and industrial overcapacity, the US statement added.
Meanwhile, Beijing urged Washington ""to attach importance to the specific concerns of Chinese companies, lift sanctions on Chinese companies as soon as possible, and improve the business environment for Chinese companies in the United States"".
Recent tariff hikes targeting $18 billion in Chinese goods came weeks before November's US presidential election, with both Democrats and Republicans pushing a hard line as competition between Washington and Beijing intensifies.
US President Joe Biden has largely maintained tariffs imposed by former president Donald Trump, which impacted some $300 billion in goods from China. The hikes this year affect earlier products and added ones.
The United States defends its restrictions on sensitive high-tech goods as aimed at limiting Chinese companies' access to cutting-edge equipment purchased abroad, particularly for military purposes.
China has condemned those curbs as ""protectionist"".
And on Tuesday, Wang said trade ties between the world's two largest economies ""should become the ballast of bilateral relations"".
Beijing, he said, was willing to push ""China-US economic and trade relations back on the correct track"".
The US Commerce Department noted that both sides have ""agreed to maintain an open channel of communication in the coming months"".

Job growth has been concentrated in a few industries, with basically all jobs added recently going towards sectors that ""only account for 48 percent of employment,"" she added.
The other half of US workers have seen ""unusually slow growth in their industries,"" Pollak said, with hiring sluggish outside sectors like government, health care, and leisure and hospitality.
Although workers had 17 months of positive real wage growth, they experienced a longer period of negative growth previously.
""There are many workers who still feel like their wages need to catch up,"" she said.

Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn said on Tuesday it is building the world's largest production plant for US hardware leader Nvidia's GB200 ""superchips"" that power artificial intelligence servers.
Foxconn, also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer and assembles devices for major tech companies, including Apple.
Ambitious to expand beyond electronics assembly, it has been pushing into areas ranging from electric vehicles to semiconductors and servers.
""We're building the largest GB200 production facility on the planet,"" senior executive Benjamin Ting said at the company's annual ""Hon Hai Tech Day"".
""I don't think I can say where now, but it's the largest on the planet,"" said Ting, Foxconn's senior vice president for the cloud enterprise solutions business.
Chairman Young Liu said while opening the two-day event that Foxconn would be ""the first to ship these superchips"".
Liu later told reporters the new plant was in Mexico.
Unlike its rivals Intel, Micron and Texas Instruments, Nvidia does not manufacture its own chips but uses subcontractors.
Foxconn also unveiled new electric vehicle prototypes at the tech day -- a seven-seater lifestyle multipurpose utility vehicle and a 21-seater bus.
It plans to do with electric vehicles what it did for gadgets -- become a go-to contract builder.
Foxconn announced last year that it would team up with Nvidia to create ""AI factories"" -- powerful data-processing centres that would drive the production of next-generation products.

Swedish retail giant H&M Group has partnered with Chorka Textile Ltd in Bangladesh to pilot new technologies to significantly reduce water, energy and chemical consumption in textile production.
The initiative involves European Plan Zero members Revozona AG, Imogo AB, and Pluvia, whose technologies will be assessed together for the first time under one roof, according to a statement from H&M.
The goal is to evaluate the combined potential of these technologies to make production processes more sustainable.
This partnership is crucial for finding scalable climate solutions, according to Ziaur Rahman, country manager of H&M Bangladesh.
He said the partnership supports the multinational retail brand's goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 56 percent and reducing freshwater extraction and consumption by 30 percent across its supply chain by 2030.
Rahman said electrification is key to systemic solutions in the industry, but it requires a reliable grid infrastructure. Engaging stakeholders is essential to ensure the success of such transitions, he added.
Gérard J. Peters, global coordinator of Plan Zero, described the initiative as a catalyst for sustainable transformation in the textile sector.
He noted that combining innovative technologies will help reduce environmental impacts and align fashion with sustainability.
Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, Chairman & CEO of Pran RFL Group, which owns Chorka Textile, highlighted that environmental concerns are vital in densely populated Bangladesh.
He affirmed that partnering with H&M would allow both companies to implement global best practices in sustainability, benefiting not only Bangladesh but the world.

Bangladesh's exports grew by 5 percent year-on-year to $11.37 billion in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, driven by increased shipments of apparel, according to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
Exporters earned $3.5 billion in September this year, posting a 6.78 percent year-on-year rise, according to the EPB.
The bureau released the export data after a three-month delay due to efforts to reconcile discrepancies in reported export earnings.
In July, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) published data showing that actual shipments for the July-April period of the 2023-24 fiscal year were nearly $14 billion lower than the export figures initially reported by the EPB.
The discrepancy between export figures has persisted for at least 12 years, with the gap surpassing $12 billion in 2022-23 fiscal year.
In the latest data, EPB has also corrected the export figures for September 2023.
Last year, the EPB reported $4.3 billion in exports for September 2023, while the actual figure was $3.2 billion, revealing an overestimation of $1.1 billion.

The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has reduced the regulatory duty on sugar imports by half, lowering it to 15 percent from 30 percent, to reduce the price of sugar.

The NBR expects that sugar prices will decrease in proportion to the duty reduction, and it hopes this measure will also discourage sugar smuggling.
Retail sugar prices in Dhaka have increased by 2 percent over the past month, ranging from Tk 125 to Tk 135 per kilogramme, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) has instructed banks to freeze the accounts of ABM Mokammel Hoque Chowdhury, managing director of Union Bank, and his wife.
The anti-money laundering agency issued the directive yesterday to suspend transactions in both their personal and business accounts for 30 days.
The BFIU also asked banks to submit all transaction records and vouchers over Tk 5 lakh of the Union Bank MD within the next two business days.
ABM Mokammel Hoque Chowdhury is reportedly a close associate of Mohammed Saiful Alam, chairman of the Chattogram-based conglomerate S Alam Group, which is believed to be a major beneficiary of the Awami League government ousted in August this year.
Union Bank is one of the six banks where the S Alam Group had significant influence over the board.
Recently, the central bank reconstituted Union Bank's board.
While the bank is struggling to repay its depositors, on October 2 and 3, Chowdhury withdrew Tk 1.53 crore from the bank.
The Daily Star tried to reach Mokammel over phone for comments. He did not respond  immediately.
